They're closed on Sunday, so even though we got home on Sunday, we had to leave him here another day (and pay for another day) because we couldn't pick him up until Monday morning.  He got a complimentary bath with his boarding.  When I did pick him up, once I got him in the car I noticed a very pungent, musky odor.  Couldn't figure out what it was until I got him home the smell was so bad I had to leave the car windows open to air it out.  He had a greenish "material" on the underside of his tail and around his butt.  I tried to clean it off.  Let him outside and he had watery diarrhea.  I called them and asked why the stinky green stuff wasn't noticed by their groomer.  They said he did notice it and figured he had "rolled in something".  They didn't clean it all off and sent him home that way.  It was anal gland secretions, and I'm thinking why a groomer, working at a veterinary hospital wouldn't recognize that and go grab a tech somewhere (they're all over the place) to have them take a look.  I had to bring my poor dog all the way back over there, making me late for work, for something they never should've sent him home with.  They did express his anal glands, but brought him out to me still stinky and leaving oily green stuff where he was sitting in their lobby.  I asked the gal behind the counter "what is this", she tried to tell me it was soap.  I asked for a tissue and wiped it up, showed it to her and asked "does this look like soap?  Would you like to tell me if you think it smells like soap?"  They AGAIN took him back and cleaned him off.  Then prescribed anti-diarrheal medication as they noticed he had bad diarrhea while he was back there.  I will never board my dog here again.",2,3,2

On my first visit, I attempted to present the Groupon using the Groupon app on my iPhone.  I was rudely told me that the phone screen would not suffice and that I would have to print the coupon and physically present it to them.  

I returned the next morning with the printed copy in hand.  The desk attendant took the paper and entered my information into the computer.  She then told me that I would have to pay an additional $4 for the spray tan cartridge.  This additional fee was not disclosed anywhere in the Groupon deal write-up and increased the cost of each tan by 58%.  I was disappointed, to say the least.

I know that Groupon catches a lot of flack for situations like these, but really it is the fault of the individual businesses.  They clearly used deceptive advertising to rope people in on the Groupon deal and surprise them with the additional costs.  

Between the snobby, crispy desk attendant I interacted with the first night and the deceptive advertising, this experience has left a seriously bad taste in my mouth.  I have asked Groupon for a refund and I will not be returning to the Shadyside Hollywood Tans.",12,6,1

Stayed here this past weekend for my first time being in Scottsdale. I will say that the love is so real that I do not plan to ever stay anywhere else. This hotel is in such a convenient location that you will never have to take an Uber any where! We were walking distance by the big mall (that I never made it to) and from all the nightlife (which of course I made it to!). As read in the other reviews, this is NOT the place for kids and families to go to and it is loud with music from all the clubs surounding this place. If you are a light sleeper, good luck! The rooms are pricey but well worth it!

PROS: 
-Cabanas are super reasonable price! On a saturday I got a day bed cabana which consisted of two day beds under a canopy right by the pool and it was only $100. Perfect for just me and my girlfriend!
-Drinks and food were great! So great that all weekend, we ate at the hotel!
-The people that work here are so friendly and so beautiful
-Pool was perfect for lounging and never over crowded
-DJ at the pool on weekends was awesome! 
-The hotel offers late check out for a small additional fee. We were able to check out at 6:00pm which was perfect because that is the time we needed to leave for the airport.
-To use the elevators you need your room key which I love to keep the creepsters out.
-The rooms were amazing and the bed was soooo comfortable!

CONS:
-During the DJ/Party times at the pool, we weren't allowed to take a nap in our paid cabana. The workers will actually tell you no sleeping. Strange! What if I wasn't sleeping and just resting my eyes! 
-Not sure when the pool closes but I do wish it was open for a relaxing night swim. Went Sunday night for a night swim and it was closed

As you can tell, there were many Pros and not many Cons! Successful hotel!

P.S. Stayed for 3 whole days and ONLY left the hotel once! Haha!",1,1,0

I go to a different place for my nails but I heard good things about this place from yelp and my boyfriend who occasionally gets a pedicure from here. Since we were next door at Costco my sister had mentioned she had wanted to get her nails done for her birthday so I recommended that we go there when we were done. 

Upon arriving we signed in and waited for our turn. I decided to change the polish on my nails so I signed in for both of us. We waited about 5 min and they took me first so I got my polish changed. A few minutes later a different girl had seated my sister and started on her full set. She placed the tip on and started to cut them and then said a different girl would finish and left her sitting there. I don't mind that u needed to leave early she should have just waited for someone to complete the job one time. As I got up from the nail dryer I saw her siting there and asked what's going on. The nail tech next to her said she would finish as soon as she was done with the job she was doing but didn't and started on a pedicure. Meanwhile my sister has been waiting at least 15 min meanwhile the guy there was going to start on someone else when he noticed that she needed to have her nails finished. So he took her and finished them and then she has to go to a third person for the paint and design. 

I'm rating it 2 stars based on there  service. Granted we did come in at 5 pm and they close at 6 but they were still taking walk ins well after we came in. The wait wasn't the issue for me. I don't mind  waiting just don't have us sit down and then wait for someone to come finish the job. I would have rated 1 star but they offered me water. I'm glad my nail tech is private and I don't have to come to nail establishments like this.",5,4,3

The Regal 18 is located in Village Square, which is super convenient because it's perfect for a date night since there are so many restaurants in this plaza. 

When you walk in here, it's your typical standard theater with a concession stand, two sides for the multiple movies that are playing, and vending machines with candy. 
The ticket takers in the front check your bag before letting anyone in the theater. Honestly, I am okay with that, with all the craziness going on at movie theaters these days it's better safe than sorry.

The seats don't recline back, but they are comfy. I think they made the seats non-reclinable to cut down on the douchebag factor, you know, people who kick their seats backs so far they are practically in your lap. 

The movie screen is huge, so no matter where you're sitting you will still have a good view of the flick you're watching.

My first visit I specifically requested Dr. Woodson herself after reading a lot of neutral to negative reviews for her PA and NP. After filling out a ton of paperwork (most of which was not very welcoming- I think I signed about three different forms promising I would definitely pay my bill or be sent to a debt collector. I get they want their money, but what a way to greet your new patients!) I went into the exam room and lo and behold PA John Notabartolo walks into the room. Since I was already there I just went with it. He examined my skin (I went in for some mild adult acne) for less than ten seconds, told me basic skin care advice that I've known about for years, and then wrote me some prescriptions. The whole visit with him lasted about three minutes. No real suggestions or overview of my current skin care regime, no explanation of the possible cause of my condition or what level of severity it was. Basically the only thing I couldn't have found on my own online was the prescriptions.

As another reviewer noted, they tend to prescribe the newest brand name drugs and of course both of mine were brand name and expensive! Thankfully my insurance covered mine with a reasonable co-pay, but definitely double check with your insurance before getting them filled. The prescriptions did help my skin, which was awesome. I went back for a follow up as they'd requested to see me in a few weeks and after waiting for over forty minutes past my appointment time was taken back with very little apology for the wait. Again another three minute visit with the PA with another very hurried skin examination and I left wondering why I'd wasted two hours of my time and another doctor's bill.

Only one lady at the front desk was very friendly; everyone one else in the office seemed less than thrilled to be there. They did call with appointment reminders, which was nice, however the first time they left a voicemail with the time but not the date, and the second time they left a voicemail with one time and then called back and left another voicemail with a different time. Their bills also have the quickest due date I have ever seen. They give you 10 days from when they print the bill until the due date- but they seem to take 1-2 days to mail the bill (so 8 days left), plus 1-2 days in the mail (6 days left), so by the time you get it you have about 4-5 days to get it in the mail to make sure it arrives on time. You better hope you're not on vacation when they send the bill!

The last in the chain of events to make me move on to a new doctor was when I called to reschedule my third appointment and was put on hold for 7 minutes and then was greeted by a bored sounding woman who barely apologized for the wait. Instead of rescheduling I just asked her to cancel. I hung up and smiled as I realized I'd successfully broken up with my doctor.

Nothing this office did was horrible, but nothing they did was great either. The little moments of what I consider mediocre medical care and blase customer service just added up for me to the point where I didn't want to deal with it anymore. There's plenty of dermatology offices in this city and given the low reviews dating back for years I feel like this office isn't that interested in improving their business- so I'll just take mine elsewhere.",12,0,0

I usually order Pi Tom's own version of Pad Thai....they also have a 'Traditional' version too but I prefer the restaurants own and it is delicious. The ingredients for both dishes are practically the same but Pi Toms dish uses a lighter, more subtle sauce (not ketchup like most traditional pad thai dishes) leaving the flavours of the other ingredients to be fully appreciated. They give pretty decent portion sizes....I rarely finish the entire thing but makes for a great lunch the next day...

The mango salad here is to die for! Really fresh ingredients makes this salad extra special and they use a delicious sweet dressing. 

There are many Pi Toms around Toronto but this one is my personal favourite...its on a nice, fairly quiet street just off Yonge and Wellesley , and has a cute patio complete with romantic lighting, perfect for a dinner date or a relaxing night with a friend.

My grandson was visiting from Cali for spring break and wanted to go bowling yesterday.  I am on their email list and had received a coupon for two hours of bowling with shoes, food, etc for $7.99.  I asked for the special rate and was very rudely told that it doesn't apply during spring break and that lanes were $3+ and shoes were $4.50.  When I asked about who has spring break now he rudely replied Paradise Valley schools.  Really????  This was Scottsdale, wtf?
So I paid over $30 for three of us to bowl.  When I asked for two lanes (one w/ bumper for grandson) he acted really put out.
We had a good time, but both my daughter and myself have our own shoes and I felt ripped off and hate rude workers, so I was mad.
Then afterwords we went to the game part of the place and almost every game was broken or did not give out tickets.  My grandson wanted to play ski ball he loves and they were broken too.  Of course the desk people could care less.

Atmosphere was nice, I love the Lakewood vibe and this place fits right in.

Drinks were good, strong. One of the perks of waiting is getting just a little tipsy. 

My waitress Natalie was nice, can't really blame her for the long wait, but she did everything we asked.

Three problems.

The wait: Now I don't want to be too hard on them because I can imagine how difficult opening week is before everyone gets into the groove of things. But we ordered our appetizer ( which is two veggie egg rolls ) and two maki rolls ( one Lakewood maki and the one Crab Rangoon) at the same time. It took about twenty mins for the appetizer and then another forty mins on top of that for our maki rolls. If the wait will be this long I can only hope they will provide some type of munchies to keep us distracted. Like wontons and dip or something. 

The Food: The veggie egg rolls came out soggy in the middle, it was good but the inside was way softer than any egg roll I've ever tasted, as if the oil was not hot enough so the egg roll oil sucked up the oil a little more.  But it was good, 3/5. When the maki rolls finally came out, my maki felt like it was sitting out a little longer than the other one but it was good just wished I could taste the heat from it being deep fried. 

The TV: My only personal pet peeve is too have a variety of channels going on multi TVs not only one game going on, especially if we are loosing, winning no problem, I love being apart of the hype. But when the wait for food is over a hour long and shark week is on, never change shark week. 

Looking forward to coming back, hoping the wait isn't as long and I can tune into shark week.",3,0,0

And it will definitely be my and my family and friend's last time back. 

A whoppin' one star! Here's why:
1. Their pho is still good. Not my favorite, but it's still good. Our server was a nice guy. 
2. We order a flat noodle stir fry dish -- so greasy and 60% of it was white onions, not noodles. Did we order a plate of onions with some noodles and shrimp in it??? Plus, our order was placed wrong in the first place, so we had to wait again for the correct order. Our server was apologetic, so that's fine. 
3. I ordered thai tea, but they were out of half & half, for about another 20-30 minutes. You want to wait? Yeah, sure. Half&half gets delivered....eventually, our server remembers and asks if I still want thai tea. Yes, please. Never got it. But I ended up somewhere else after to fix my craving, and I'm super glad I went somewhere else to splurge my money. 
4. Substituted two orders of pho that had eye round steak for beef meatballs in one and tripe in the other. Got charged extra because they said beef meatballs and beef tripe are each worth more than eye round steak. 
First of all, if a bowl of pho w/ steak is $6.99, and a bowl of pho w/ meatballs is $6.99, how is one worth more than the other? Second, TRIPE IS WORTH MORE THAN STEAK?! I know no one besides my father that would want tripe over steak. Third, our server said he would ask if I can substitute and let me know, but he never let me know. Fourth, I eat A LOT of pho everywhere, no joke, and I have never ever had to pay extra. But then again, all the places I go to actually have a menu item that has brisket and meatball. And guess what, it's the same price as all the other pho bowls w/ two meats. 
Anyways, super irritated that the owner argued with me that meatballs and tripe are each worth more than steak, hence they have to charge to make up the difference. Please. 
5. I guess last time I went the bowls were $6, now it's $7. 
6. The spring rolls -- meh. It had so much lettuce in there, and the peanut sauce was very watery. I've had much better spring rolls. 
7. It's still a nice and clean restaurant.

Spas of AZ have 4 Valley locations. There website is different than their name. Their website is: http://acrylicspasaz.com/

Completely different than their store name... ANYWAY! My wife and I go in to the store after several happy hour drinks one day at Logan Grill (right next door) and we want to buy a spa. We had been talking about this for a while and we thought since we had extra liquid courage that we could finally just go and pick one!.

Well, spas are not cheap. Cheapest tub in the place at that time was $3,500. We had our eye on one that didn't have water in it, so all we could do is just imagine what the jets felt like. The sales guy Forest, explained to us that we would love it and yada yada. All we said we wanted is strong jets to massage our sore muscles after the gym or other physical activities that we do. We ended up buying one for $200 bucks more that the cheapest one - paid in full - had a 30 day fix warranty. They do not do refunds or returns just fyi.

We were happy. Then we realized we had to have a concrete pour, and a 220v line extended 80 feet to our back yard from the breaker box. Concrete Pour 10.5'x10.5'= $650. 220v line $989.

Day of hot tub delivery - 
I got a call from the the delivery guys stating they were at my house, I was luckily able to leave work and meet them. They didn't call 30 minutes before like they said they would and they forgot to bring my chemicals that were also promised to me. Side note** they also looked like two gang bangers right out of a C.O.P.S. episode. I'm sure to the older generation they would seem pretty scary. Spas of AZ may want to look in to uniforms.

Fast fwd 2 weeks - 
The jets were so weak, the hot tub wouldn't get very hot, and there was a leak. I called the service guy to come out and he did in a very quick manner. Said he would put an order in for the parts and have everything fixed up by next week. At this time, I was getting very close to that 30 day warranty limit they say you have. Well our hot tub sucked and no one was doing anything about it.

2 weeks later still nothing.

I call Forest and basically yell at him and then I do the same to the corporate office on Bell Rd. They acted faster than I thought they would. They said that they would give me an upgraded tub (a $500 more expensive one), a year of chemicals, a free step-up to the hot tub, free delivery and hook-up, and free to take the old hot tub away. All I had to do was pay $250 of the $500.

Let me just say my wife and I would have paid $500 more originally on a hot tub if we knew the jets were actually what we wanted. There was just no way to tell in the beginning besides believing the word of Forest the salesman.

Well they kept their word and made everything right. We love our new hot tub, and it is perfect for us. 1 thing you should know when buying a hot tub is: 

Never get a 110v hot tub. I don't care if they say it is convertible to a 220v. Always get a 200v. No matter what the salesman tells you.",3,0,0

I'm a server myself so I know that lots of places don't acknowledge tips, good or bad, and that's just how it is. It was nice to hear a genuine thank you. She even told us she hoped our flight home in the morning was safe.

The service was terrible. It was incredibly hard to locate our waitress. We have twin toddlers which do not have an ounce of patience and even though I came fully equipped with snacks and drinks they all ran out before we could get our food. The food not impressive, my husband's burger was dry(for which we had to wait 30 minutes for ketchup). My quesadilla was extremely greasy and our sweet potato fries were cold. It took one of the family members I brought having to ask 3 times for a refill on her Sprite for which she got when she was done eating her sandwich. By the time the desert came I was so discouraged that I didn't even want to try it. I am completely disappointed at this establishment and embarrassed that I brought out of towners here.",2,0,0

All of the credit has to go Jonathan and the great business he has going with Kimberfire. 
Like a lot of guys, I am utterly clueless about jewelry and what constitutes a wearable as 'beautiful' (finding good places to eat is more up my alley!). Straight away however, Jonathan's warm personality, expert knowledge, and professional demeanor had me at ease. I could feel right a way that I was in good hands...the guy just oozes integrity!
The ring came out more beautiful than I could ever have imagined, and of course she said yes! I couldn't recommend buying your engagement ring at Kimberfire highly enough. My only advice would be that if you need to wait 8 or so weeks for a consultation, don't be intimidated - lock it in straight away!

Whenever I'm craving Korean BBQ and don't have much $$ I go here strictly for the price. It's a lot more affordable than other ayce places which will cost me (+ tip) around $30 for dinner. The meat and banchans are pretty good, not crappy at all. They do lack desserts but so does Sura. I guess desserts aren't highlighted in Korean BBQ because people are too stuffed with meat and ran out of room for anything sweet afterwards. Everything they serve on the buffet may not be an A+... maybe a B- 

They have at least 4 different marinated meat selections and another 3 or 4 "dry" meat which includes beef, pork and chicken. They also serve seafood such as shrimp and squid. They have all sorts of "salads" or cold dishes, along side other appetizers? Such as pot stickers and grilled fish. They also serve sushi rolls but I never give those any attention. If I want to eat sushi, ayce Korean BBQ (or any buffet in general) ain't the place. I go to ayce sushi joints for that. They serve rose tea and I'm addicted to it. I'd drink like 5 servings lol

Tables are always nice and clean. Same with the washrooms. The staff are really nice too! A major problem I find staying here for long periods of time is the really cold air conditioning. It gets really chilly/uncomfortable with a T shirt on during the summer.

In general, I like the atmosphere at this Second Cup. It's usually quieter than at a McDonalds. It definitely makes studying a lot easier. But! I would still prefer going to a Free Wi-Fi McDonalds because the menu items are more affordable for a student budget.

Update: I came here with outside food and drink in the morning and was kicked out by the owner/manager. I know there's a sign saying no outside food or drink, but I never thought I'd be kicked out. Just a warning, if you plan on staying, buy something... probably something cheap.",1,0,0

Very helpful energetic staff. Clean, modern facilities. Free lockers and clip in spin shoes. This is probably the closest to the SoulCycle experience that I have found in the Valley. Stadium style spin room. It seems like there are a lot of bikes in the room, but I did not feel like the other riders were too close, like in some studios. Great music, lots of variety in the ride, with upper body work with a weighted bar during one song. They have a board that shows a score for the top 10 riders (based on speed and resistance) several times during class, which definitely got me moving faster. Women's room has four showers, nice smelling shower products and extras like Olay face wash, hair elastics, hair dryers. The bathroom is configured poorly, so if you are blow drying your hair or putting on makeup near the front of the bathroom, you are visible every time the door opens.

The first thing I ate there was the Old Town Burger and ohhhhhhhhhh it was AMAZING. Probably one of the best burgers I've had in my life. The bartender told me they grind together several different cuts to create this burger, one of which is filet mignon. You really can taste the quality. Toppings are extra, I topped mine with the grafton cheddar. 

My second night, Old Town Whiskey introduced their new happy hour menu. It includes a lot of the same appetizers on their regular menu but at a reduced price. ($4 from 4-5pm, $5 from 5-6pm, and $6 from 6-7pm.) The quality of the food was again, outstanding. I got the pickled beets with whipped ricotta on sourdough and my friend got the duck fat fries. $4 was a steal in my opinion compared to the quality of the food and the drinks. Speaking of drinks...

It is a bar first and foremost. The selection of tradition whiskeys, scotches, and bourbons is impressive. The flights were a bit pricey for me so I let the bartenders (or mixologists I should say) prepare a variety of drinks for me. The service I received was outstanding, everyone was really friendly. 

My final night, my friends and I stopped in for a couple of drinks. I decided to try the S'mores milkshake and surprise, surprise, it was extremely tasty. Little toasted marshmallows on top and everything. 

I cannot recommend this place enough. If for no other reason, try this place to say that you ate at "Iron Chef" Jose Garces' place. That's kind of exciting, right?",8,3,4

We ordered two rolls, as an appetizer, and two entrées. I was disappointed with the Vegas roll. I won't order it again. The other role, Philly, was pretty good. I ordered the curry rice for dinner. The dish had just the right amount of spice (maybe too spicy for those who don't like hot/spicy food). Unfortunately, the chicken was fried. I don't believe it said that on the menu or else I wouldn't have ordered it. The fried chicken was cut into thin strips and there was a lot of it. It was served over rice. The curry was a mix of potatoes and carrots. This is a good dish, if you don't mind fried. My friend ordered the teriyaki chicken. The chicken was grilled and served over rice and a small side salad. (I will order this next time.) Both entrées were big enough to split, especially after having the appetizer rolls.

We decided to visit randomly after seeing their posts on Facebook about their new desserts. I will admit that it does not disappoint. Server Brett was incredibly attentive and very engaging. He brought us refills quickly and suggested menu items. He was very knowledgeable about the menu items and he made us feel welcome. We were a party of three adults and one two year old. The restaurant was very busy which was nice to see and they were nice enough to accommodate us. We had come out with  dessert in mind originally, but decided to try a few appetizers as well.
The honey garlic & hoisin sauce wings was delicious and were the two year olds favorite item. And to appease such a picky eater says a lot. 
The mini pork belly tacos were another hit all around, it was sweet with a hint of heat. The pork belly was a balance of rich flavours and moist pork belly, the crunch of the accompanying carrot slaw was exceptional. This was my personal favourite.
The Philadelphia cheesesteak egg roll was another amazing appetizer. Shaved pieces of steak and cheese nestled in a light egg roll wrapper that was accompanied by a sour cream like dipping sauce with a mild kick of wasabi rounded out this dish. It was my bfs favourite and had a milder flavour In comparison to the other dishes.
The butter chicken nachos were butter chicken over corn tortillas with the general nacho toppings of cheese, tomatos and green onions. This was different and enjoyed by everyone.
The crispy fried cauliflower wings were enjoyed by my bf and his sister, I absolutely despise cauliflower so I could not bring myself to try it. The only complaint was that it was a bit overly spicy.
For dessert I tried the cheesecake and it was phenomenal. My boyfriend had the Bailey's creme brulee and I snagged a bite of it, it was amazing! I have never seen my boyfriend order a second dessert in the many years we have been dating and this time he ordered a second creme brulee. His sister tried the stewed fruit pizza, it's a very large dessert that can be shared, she loved it and had leftovers for breakfast.

Given the lack of amenities, you basically pay much more compared to other costs of accessing those amenities outside of apartment complex! The payment system is outdated, you basically have to keep your own records about payment information and management is clueless about their communication with residents. 
Its not everyday that management is unreasonable, but occasionally (and recently a lot) management tends to not communicate properly, take things for granted, and have no decency in the way they interact with tenants.

Absolute no sense of time for interaction during weekdays. Many a times, office is closed at 4:30 even though the timings say they are open till 5, which makes it hard for working professionals to clarify issues with management. And management has no sense of keeping proper records. All they do when they mess-up communication is shout and yell at tenants than amicably resolving the issue by providing further clarification. 

Tip: Whatever you talk to the management, take their signature with agreement on paper. (I faced this issue, and I had to give in to their demands and pay extra rent!).",1,0,0

Situated in a basement property on Haddington Place, you might miss Emma Hall Hair Design if you didn't know it was there, but next to its neighbour Ivy, the two specialise in organic treatments so you can be sure that you're putting your hair and the environment in safe hands.

It was here where I took the plunge and had my near waist-length hair chopped off, and since then have kept it in a graduated bob, occasionally going really quite short, but usually a little past my ears.  I've had to switch stylist, as my original one left, but my current, Laura, is great. She gets what I want.  I'll be honest, I've tried out a couple of the others, but Laura's cuts come closest to what I attempt to describe (or in other words, Laura gives me the modern take on the 1920s bob that I want, and doesn't leave me looking like a  90s era Monica from Friends).

Prices are reasonable, and if you check in on Yelp or on Facebook you'll get a 10% discount.  You'll get a nice wee bit of chocolate fudge with your tea (if you have time to drink it, when does anyone have time to drink tea during a hair cut apart from when your hairdresser nips off to get the hair dryer?), and the music's usually pretty good.  Keep an eye on their Facebook page too, as they do special packages at a huge discount fairly regularly, which although I've not bought one, would be definitely worthwhile if you were someone who got your hair coloured regularly, or who wanted to be pampered.  They will also advertise when they've got stand by appointments available, for those of you who aren't fussy about which stylist you get so long as you get a bargain!

And did I mention you can book online? I love anywhere that lets me book online.",3,0,1

I thought I did enough research and chose the right place, but I ended up extremely pissed and disappointed. First off, when I called for an appointment I confirmed with Gina the receptionist that they were in network and requested a price estimate after insurance. Second, I go to my appointment, explain my severe allergies, swollen face, runny nose and all and the doctor chuckles and says "I'm trying to figure out why you are here to see me." Literally those were his words. I blew it off. He advised that they would do one set of tests on day one and I had to come back to do a second set of tests on day two. This is because they only test on the arms and there wasn't enough arm space. When I asked the doctor why he doesn't test anywhere else on the body he told me it was simply so his patients could see the results, no medical reason. (I later figured out this is so they can charge you twice.) I did my testing and also wanted to do food allergy, gluten and dairy testing and the doctor refused with no reasoning. I asked a second time and he said maybe next time. I was insistent because this was something I really wanted and he said he doesn't recommend it and said adults usually have false negatives. At this point I wasn't asking I was telling him this is what I wanted. He leaves for 20 minutes and comes back with a paper, doesn't explain a single thing and tells me to have a nice day. Apparently, it turned out to be a referral to another allergy blood testing center. I had no idea. Gina advised that insurance came back and my co pay was $35. I also asked the if anything would be charged for the second visit and I was told NO. Sure enough nothing was charged for the second visit, not even a copay. Then it gets better, I get a bill in the mail for $600!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! They charge $140 for a new patient fee, $760 for the two days of allergy testing, an extra $35 copay that they didn't charge for the second visit and some other stupid fees.

This has to be one of the worst nail experiences I have ever had.  You would think what they lack in talent they make up for in customer service but that is not the case.  I went there to have my nails done since they are on my way home.  I told them many times I wanted the bio gel UV nails and after doing a clear coat of that she proceeded to put shellac on my nails, I asked her again and she said that it will last longer since there is gel underneath, so I went with it.  I got a black and red french manicure with gems on one finger and the grant total was $60.  I mentioned to the lady that the last time I did gel nails which I had on at the time (done somewhere else) they lasted me 5 weeks and she said these will last even longer.  Anyway 2 days later one nail chipped and then another and then by Monday the gems had fallen off.  I called them to complain and that I wanted a refund they said they don't do that and that the manager would call me back.  They did not and I had to call back and they asked me to come back in to have it redone so I reluctantly agreed.  I went back in on Tuesday to have them redone and the service I received was beyond AWFUL.  The lady who greeted me said that it was somehow my fault my nails had chipped and that she would only do a color and not the french or gems even though that is what I paid for.  I asked to speak to a manager and apparently there is never anyone there who is equipped to handle any customer issues.  Anyway she did an absolutely AWFUL job with my nails and practically painted my fingers in the process, I would have been able to do a better job on my own at home.  The whole time she  was RUDE and extremely unaccommodating.  I will NEVER go back to this place and I strongly suggest anyone considering to go here will go elsewhere.

I was visiting the beautiful city of Las Vegas for my (not so) monumentous 25th birthday. I asked an internet forum for vape shops whilst I stayed in the city, since I was low on my nectars. 

To my surprise, the was an overwhelming amount of support for elephant vapors. Their prices, bottle sizes, and flavor selections. 

I left the strip and made the trek, with my mother (and novice vaper) in tow. I walked in to see luscious clouds billowing about the shop, an amount of people milling about shopping and generally creating rain clouds, as well as a full, busy, and well versed staff manning the counters. 

I was immediately greeted by a friendly employee, which was beautiful. I asked about where I can view/sample flavors and they enthusiastically directed me to the rear counter. 

There were two kind gentleman, busily working, but never neglecting the customers whilst mixing flavors. (Fuck it, we're doing it live)

I tell the kind man (I forget his name, but you sir were a saint) that I am a fruit, or floral flavor kind of person. He immediately handed me bottles of fluids to drip and sample. 

I selected melonlicious, and the creep. My mother selected candy apple. 

I told them what nic content and pg/vg ratio we were looking for and too my surprise they mixed it right in front of me! (Say what?!)

In the midst of my being starstruck, I ordered a 30ml of melonlicious, and a 120ml of the creep. 3mg nic, 100% vg, because I enjoy my drips. 

Mom got her candy apple at 0mg nic, with a 50/50 blend. 

We even got her boyfriend some liquid as well.
He is a tobacco/coffee flavor only kinda guy, and they had,

And I shit you not

The absolute, most accurate, and flavorful tobacco blend of liquid I have ever tasted in my vaping career. 

No really, get in on that. 

Its called east meets west, and tell them some asshole from california said it was the absolute tits and you need 120ml NOW. 





All together, this was one of the most involved, and positive experiences with a vape shop I have ever experienced. 

Also, elephant vapors, if you read this- get a Goddamn website. I need to order more. I cant drive 10+ hours just for the sweet ambrosia you make, but I will gladly pay nearly any price for what you make. 


Elephant vapors: 10/10
Flavor: 10/10
Customer service: 10/10

There was a 7 year old kid munching on his taco, watching my carding go down. We locked eyes for a moment while the bouncer flashed his light on my ID, I think the child was mocking me. I was wondering why he was allowed in. Oh well. 

After that puzzling moment, I met the gang.

After removing many square feet of concrete, Rob Plowright and his team converted my backyard into a desert oasis.  
I met Rob Plowright with Desert Designer at the home show in February 2016.  Rob was one of five landscape designers who I interviewed.  I ultimately decided to go with Desert Designer because Rob understood how I wanted to use my yard and the problems that I had with the space in its original state.  Rob came up with a great plan that was functional and esthetically pleasing.  In fact, he took an off-hand comment that I had made about eventually wanting a container garden on the side yard, and came up with a unique container garden that will withstand prolonged sun exposure without deteriorating.  Rob is also extremely organized and detail-oriented.  He was the only one of the five designers who I interviewed who scheduled a follow-up appointment at the time of our first meeting.  Within a week of our first meeting, I had received multiple emails with alternative price lists and pictures of the proposed plants.  At our second meeting, Rob presented his plans with line-item pricelists, walked me through two proposals, and explained to me why he made the choices that he did.  Although other designers may have had fancier presentations with 3D computer models, Rob's plan was spot-on to my vision and under budget!  In fact, because the estimate was so reasonable, I ultimately expanded the project to include additional landscaping in the backyard and replacement of the irrigation system in the front yard.  Rob was also patient and responsive to the numerous questions that I emailed him sent before, during, and after the project was complete.
On the day my project was scheduled to begin, the Desert Designer team was on time (maybe even earlier), and worked quickly without sacrificing attention to detail.  Not only did the team work efficiently, finishing the project in just four days, but it was done perfectly, and my yard and the street were immaculate.  Even my neighbors commented on how great a job Desert Designers had done on cleaning up.  And because the workers are employees, and not merely contracted for the day or project, I didn't worry while I was at work about whether they would show up or complete the day.  The following day, I met Rob at my house where he gave me an orientation on plant care, the new irrigation system, and the warranty on the pavers and labor. Like any home improvement project, there were a few hiccups along the way, but I had complete confidence that Desert Designer would make sure the job was completed to the highest standards.  
I am beyond pleased with the way my backyard turned out.  If you are looking to transform your yard, I highly recommend that you contact Desert Designer.",3,0,0

It's a small Starbucks, but right outside of Haymarket station so convenient all the same.  I haven't noticed a difference between here and other Starbucks in all honesty, other than it being a bit smaller than I'm used to, so it is what it is... if you're looking for a convenient Starbucks for the station then this one will certainly do.

One plus point is that every now and again at a Starbucks I get a watery frappucino... you know, the kind that just isn't icy enough... I hate it when that happens!  I can't say I've really had that happen here though.

Maybe it's my fault. I primarily do take out orders at this store. Look, I get that it's always busy here. But, why is it always a cluster-expletive at the hostess stand and waiting area? There are enough people behind that counter to land a space shuttle. How is my five minute interaction with the workers here always awful?

My latest unfortunate service experience: I placed my take out order Sunday for soup and egg rolls. And by Sunday, I mean it was 3:30pm. It wasn't during church rush-hour. The girl who took my order warned me that at the moment it was taking 25 minutes for to-go orders. Okay, that's fine. She also talked to me like she would rather play in traffic than be behind that counter. Here's the real problem: my order came out ten minutes later. No one even bothered to look at the bag. I never gave it a second thought because I was told it would be at least 25 minutes. I figured it was a call-in order and that's why no one did anything. So, 30 minutes after placing my order I finally walked up to ask about my food. I was handed the bag, which was the only bag there on the counter. I said, "oh, it's the bag that's been sitting there for 20 minutes and no one called my name." The girl just kind of rolled her eyes and gave me attitude. Sigh.

Things to know: like I said, this place is always busy. Go ahead and expect a wait. Your best bet is to make a reservation. Although, the family next to me made their reservation a week ahead of time and still had to wait for their table to be ready. Also, check the bar area. You may be able to snag a spot there. 

My favorite thing here is the egg drop soup. I usually just order a large size of that and the lettuce wraps for my meal. I'm also a fan of the Sichuan-style asparagus.

I don't know what the secret is to having a solid experience here. The Phillips Place location seems to function more smoothly than this one. My advice is to just be patient.",7,0,2

I had the mushroom tart followed up by the tuna tartare. Both were done well, but nothing spectacular about either of them: the tart was buttery and the tartare was nice and not overly seasoned.

The basics:
comprehensive drink menu
2 cornhole lanes (1 to rent, 1 first come first serve)
3 tabletop games
dj booth + dancefloor

I was impressed that when walking in at around 8:30pm on a Saturday we were able to try 2 of the tabletop games and play a round of cornhole all by 9:30pm (T&F can have excessive waits when signing up for bocce or shuffleboard). 

The reason I'm not stoked on this place is at 10pm they literally close the tabletop games up for the night, increasing dancefloor space. The lone tabletop game left that's up near the front, meanwhile was being used more as a drink table than allowing for anyone to actually play the game.

So while the games are fun, but the games seem to be a secondary focus here at Bangarang compared to Track & Field. Perhaps this is part of being in the heart of Little Italy where they can aim to be more of a "club", but if I actually showed up here at 10pm and there were no games aside from 1 lane of cornhole to choose from I'd be pretty disappointed. So basically I'll give this place a 4 star based on the premise of showing up before 9pm so there is still gaming time.",0,0,0

I want to lose about 20 pounds and when you put "free" food in front of me I will eat it (yes, I know that technically I paid for it but once paid there's an unlimited supply). It's a wonder I'm not as big as a house.

Having said that, my friend and I went there for lunch and were both shocked, first at the number of choices and at how good everything tasted. I was stoked to see the Mongolian buffet. Eating at a Mongolian restaurant typically costs at least as much as we paid to eat here, but I still have so many more different kinds of food to eat. 

I'm too lazy to name everything that I had and rate it, but I will say that I was surprised at how good the items like Buffalo wings and enchiladas were (at a Chinese food restaurant?). They of course had many of the Chinese buffet staples and they also tasted great. 

I really don't understand the low rating. We paid $7.99 for lunch and I don't know what more people are asking for. To have an unlimited amount of food to eat with this many food choices that are each really good on their own? I give it 5 stars because I can't imagine getting more for my lunch dollar than this.

Personally, I prefer it to YYZ, which is the only other Canadian airport I've visited.  Free wifi, which is more than I can say for most of the other airports I frequent.

I've been to Montréal on two business trips now, so I've spent approximately six hours chillin at YUL, allowing an hour for the two times I arrived, and two hours for both departures. The four or so hours I waited for departing flights to LGA or JFK were spent in the transborder area off the main terminal, and if I'm really being honest, they were all spent watching sports and drinking beer at Le Bar Sportif.

The beer selection here is not amazing by any stretch, but generally they'll have one or two local microbrews on tap.  Score!  The televisions here are huge and plentiful, showing basically all the sports games in the world that you can possibly imagine.  This place smells a little like sour soap.  Like maybe all the rags they use to wipe the bar and tabletops had gone bad.  Or maybe it's something in the drains or the sink.  Eh, they've got beer, though.  What's truly amazeballs is that they'll pour you a beer or mixed drink in a to-go cup for you to take on your flight.  I carried on a rum and coke on my last flight.

The food at Le Bar Sportif looks absolutely disgusting.  Nothing at all vegetarian.  However, there's a little sandwich cart just outside that sells pretty rock 'em sock 'em sandwiches, including the veg one I had with roasted red peppers, goat cheese, spinach, and pesto.

All of my trips through YUL have been smooth and easy.  The signage is all accurate and straightforward, the place is clean, the WCs are plentiful, and the staff are friendlier than in some other airports up north (I'm from the southern US where we're known for our friendliness).  And there's someone watching the luggage screening area, helping you put your stuff on the belt wrong-side up (I got yelled at at YYZ for putting my luggage zipper side up on the belt, although there were no signs or anyone helping, etc.).

I think I'm just being a brat because I didn't get an upgrade. I was told that because I'm a marriott gold member, I am eligible for an upgrade (yay!) ...for an extra 50 bucks...(HAYL NO.) we got there 11pm and had an early start so I was not going to pay 50 bucks more just to sleep in an upgraded room. And as a gold member I usually get free upgrades (turns up nose in disdain). So even though we had a standard room (shudders with disgust), I expect at least some basic cleanliness; especially for a hotel with a good reputation.  Instead there was someone's mascara stuck on the mirror, tape and leftover construction paper on top of the doorway (I assume it said something like Last Fling Before the Ring or some other celebratory message), the tile on the bathroom was cracked like the previous vacationers had a WWE match in there, but worst of all, the shower flooded, and oddly enough, the carpet right outside the door got wet even though the tile by the entrance of the bathroom stayed dry. It was a curious thing.

The gym is like a Las Vegas club--dark, crowded, and there's always that one person who got the body odor. I didn't have to wait for a treadmill, though, so I'm not upset. If you bring in someone who is staying in your room, but who is not on your account, you must add them to your account, or you will get charged an extra 20 bucks in addition to the 28 dollar resort charge you've already paid.

I recently moved to Las Vegas from Chicago, and took advice from a co-worker to get my hair cut from her stylist. Needless to say, $60 later I had one of the worst cuts of my life, other than when my mom cut all my hair off in the early 90's...

You all know how terrifying it is to lose your hair dresser, thank you Yelp for being here! I was running errands two weeks ago on a day off from my busy schedule, and decided it was the day to try again. I rely on Yelp for most of what I do, eat, and drink around here because I have lived in Chicago for 27 years of my life.

That being said, I came across Hotbox on Yelp and read the reviews, for those of you that had a bad experience, I feel sorry for you! I was so excited when I walked in! Although it is tough to find from the outside. 

I was greeted promptly, offered several types of beverages, I chose sangria, and even though I was at minimum 30 minutes early, I was taken right away by Whitney! Boy was I lucky! I told her that I just wanted a good haircut. I didn't want to give her a picture or try to do her job. All the direction given was that I wanted to keep as much length as possible. I told her if she was good I didn't need to tell her what to do!!! She loved it! We got started and the entire process was PERFECT! She did everything she should have through the cutting process. I have worked in several salons in my days and i know what it takes to give a good haircut. I have a lot of hair that is heavy, she dried it completely which is a feat of its own, and then proceeded to flat iron and pin cut (thin) out my layers...she rocks! I told her I would be writing a review for her, thanks Whitney! You rock and I will see you soon!

I absolutely enjoyed my experience so much that I purchased $120 worth of Moroccan Oil hair products from her! She was very informative about the product, what it does, and what it is made of. LOVE!",3,0,1

When I arrived, I quickly realized this shop is a front for 3 different companies. Best deal tires, Jia Jia moving and U- haul. This had me skeptical , but whatever. The tires were a GREAT price for the condition. (95% tread on yokohamas for $200. (Balanced & INSTALLED)

The lady brought me into the warehouse and quickly showed me the tires. She let me look them over and everything. We then returned to the front where she told me install would take a couple hours. No problem. They were clearly very busy. So, I left $30 to save the tires, she wrote me a receipt and I would return to pay the remaining fee and have them installed another day. 

Fast forward to a day later, Sunday. The website advertises they're closed Sundays, but they were open. I simply called before hand to check and she said to come on in. 

When I got there , I drove my car into the shop, she showed me the tires again, they were the same, and the install began. It took them about an hour to install 2 tires. Which is fine as it was quite busy. 

She didn't give me a receipt because I had paid cash, but, every purchase comes with 1 month warranty on the tire and the install, so that was piece of mind. (Unless you just buy the tires, without the install, then there's no warranty). Install and balancing was included, so why not?

We've actually attempted to eat here a few other times over the years but when the wait time was quoted as 2 - 3 hours we moved on to dine somewhere else. So, was this pizza worth the wait you ask? Yes, it was absolutely worth a 15 minute wait. But no meal is worth a 3 hour wait. I think it's really silly that they don't serve pizza out on the patio or next door in the wine bar or just take reservations... its sort of a power play that they make people wait around for so long like that. I just don't get it.

Anyway, I was surprised that the menu didn't have a whole lot of options. I really felt like a red sauce so that cut our choices down to three pizzas. I opted for the Margherita since that is a nice classic but of course hubby wanted some kind of meat so we added sausage. That was a very good decision since the sausage was absolutely delicious. We both loved the pizza and it was just the right amount of food for the two of us. Hubby didn't feel like it was worth the $18 but that is about what you would pay at other non-chain artisan pizza places that offer that neapolitan style pizza so I was fine with it. Our service was ok though a bit rushed. By the time we were done eating there were a few empty tables so I didn't really see why it was necessary to take our plates away immediately after my last bite (seriously, I was still chewing) and then bring the check immediately afterwards without asking if we wanted anything else. I guess that is just how they do things there.

I'm glad I went since it is such a Phoenix landmark but I don't really see any reason to return.",4,1,3

I have been to Alo (located upstairs, owned by the same chef Patrick Kriss) and while I enjoyed the tasting menu there, the experience was a bit too intimate and the service a bit too attentive for me! In my opinion, Aloette offers equally delicious food and equally stellar service in a much more relaxed environment.

They don't take reservations so it's first come, first serve for everyone. I came with my fiance on a Wednesday night around 6PM and we were lucky to get two seats at the bar right away. The place quickly filled up within the next 15-20 minutes! We got a gin and tonic and one of the cocktails, the balsam spritz. They give everyone cheesy bread with whipped yeast butter on the house to start. This was soo good! Definitely top 2 best breads I've ever had. For food, we shared the charred chorizo, burgundy snails, and the aloette burger. The chorizo and snails were such unique and flavourful dishes - I would suggest giving both of these a try. The burger was a bit more generic (although it did come with fried cheese) but it was still tasty. It came with a very generous portion of fries which tasted okay - we usually don't leave any fries behind but we were so full that we couldn't finish the whole plate even between the two of us.

Highly, highly recommend. I can't wait to try the other items on their menu.",1,0,0

I dunno, the few interesting things on the menu were $20+ and if I wanted to spend that much on "Italian" I would have just gone to Portifinos/Carabbas.

I got the 1/4 Chicken with rice, beans and plantains. All of it was good but I wasn't blown away like people suggested I would be.

Honestly I found the chicken a little greasy, the sauces overly spicy where it was more of an accomplishment to eat rather than an enjoyable accomplice to the meal (and I regularly eat spicy food) and the beans to be not worth my time.

The plantains were delicious and the ther servers were very attentive. One nice thing that they did was they did not have enough plantains for both of our plates. So, they gave me my portion and put two on my friend's plate so they could get the meals out. They then brought a side plate with the rest of the plantains when they were finished. It was a well thought out move on the part of the staff.

My friend had the chicken soup and said it was very very good especially when she spooned some broth into the rice and mashed in some avacado.

When we showed up, there were only like two other parties in the entire restaurant. We started off with the calmari appetizer and it was bland and served with an "aioli." which was just plain mayonnaise that was was really thick. We were very hungry and could not even finish the calamari. It took about forty minutes to get our pizza, which was shocking since they were not busy at all. The server did not introduce himself and was not very hospitable or inviting. I ordered a pizza that was supposed to have arugula on my pizza. They were out of arugula and asked if I would like spinach instead so I opted for that.  When my pizza came out, there was way too much spinach and it was  slimy and wilted so I took all of it off. I have had better pizza at a lower price. This place is way overpriced for the quality of food and lousy service. To top it all off, the server messed up our bill and charged us a dollar more for the beer. The menu said the beer was five dollars and they charged us six dollars. We had the server correct it and gave him our card. He ended up not running the card and gave us someone else's bill. My husband had to walk over to the bar to let him know.

But there is an evil that has somehow eluded the iron shackles of shame....the evils of German food.  It is easily in the bottom 3 of ethnic cuisines.  So I guess that makes my review a bit biased.  But let me regale you with some truth, dear reader; WHOM AMONGST YOUR FRIENDS IS A GERMAN FOOD FAN?!!?! What's that I hear?  Crickets?  That's what I thought.  And I am not counting anyone who has friends named Hans or Helmut or Kurt etc...Beer cheese? Let the Italians and French handle cheese, let the Germans handle beer and roads without speed limits.  (Kraftwerk is my favorite German export, check them out sometime).  Potato pancakes are bland and unappealing.  The thing with pancakes is this....they're not good for you, even these starchy messes.  So if you're going to indulge, go whole hog and go to a breakfast place that specializes in them. (Don't you love how pancakes have escaped the wrath of dietitians and the public? It is a desert that has hitched its ride to breakfast.  What a scam, no wonder most of us get sweaty and out of breath just reading yelp reviews). German sausages!?!?! GO TO CURE AND GET GOOD PORK PRODUCTS.  THE GERMANS CAN'T DO PORK EITHER!!!  

I guess Hofbrahaus was fighting with one hand behind their back in the first place.

Anyways...this is a fair to middling drinking place.  If you have out of town friends who come from a relatively rural or small town..they might enjoy the gimmick.

In reality there are 2 Lee Cafes. There's the Americanized Chinese food version on the front of the menu. Pretty standard fare. And then there is the authentic Chinese version in the back of the menu. And my oh my is it authentic. 

When the waitress (who was PHENOMENAL) saw my wife and I perusing the dishes in the back of the menu she brought us a tablet where we could scroll through a TON of "real" dishes (photo and English names for each). When the waitress learned we both spoke Chinese it got real and we started talking about the different dishes. My wife and I picked three dishes for lunch: Seafood and Tofu Claypot, Spicy Fish, and Chinese Water Spinach (kongxincai). The third dish wasn't on the menu but when we talked with the waitress we learned it was in season and available. At her suggestion we also had it prepared the Southern Chinese way. 

The flavor of each dish was incredible. It felt like we were in Taiwan or Southern China instead of South Carolina. My wife, who was born in Taiwan and grew up in the US, said it reminded her of her father's home cooking. The claypot had flavors I haven't tasted since my last trip to Taiwan in 2011. The spicy fish was epic; just the right flavor and spice. 

My wife and I didn't talk too much during lunch as we were busy stuffing our mouths. Each bite tasted better than the last. It's pretty rare to find a good Chinese restaurant in the States. I had Lee Cafe bookmarked on Yelp for a year but slept on it until today. I have a lot of time to make up for. My tummy is already thanking me.

The fries were bland and tasteless, the shrimp was....I don't even know, and the fish is very much akin to what you would find between two buns and slathered in tartar sauce at a certain drive through with Golden Arches.
And how do people think this is cheap?!  I ordered a kids meal, an adult meal, and an order of chicken tenders to the tune of $19.  That is not cheap!
The only joy I found in the bland food is the sauce.  It's apparently a specialty that is only available there.  The sauce is delish, but the sauce really should not be the only source of flavor in a meal, and that is the biggest problem here,",3,1,1

I didn't go there for food, just some birthday drinks before I headed to dinner. I have heard rave reviews about their food, but knew they had drinks so thought I would try it. It is a beautiful space, we were seated near the entrance, which I assume is the waiting area, which despite the door opening and closing and letting the cold in, was ok. 

We asked the staff member that sat us if we order from the bar or if someone comes to us, they said someone will come to us and gave us menus. So, over 10 minutes later no one had come to take our drink order. We should have just gone to the bar, but we weren't in a hurry so we thought maybe they were busy. Just as was about to give up and go to the bar someone came over and took our drink order, which was one beer and a gin and tonic. Needless to say, it took almost another 10 minutes before our drinks arrived. And no one came back to see if we wanted another round. 

I'm sorry, I don't mind waiting if a place is super busy, but they didn't seem to be as I watched the person that took our order chat for a few minutes with a co-worker for a while before they even started making our drinks. 

Being in the service industry, I would just have appreciated some honestly about if they were too busy to do drinks for us or if it would be quicker at the bar. I will at some point go back in for food as I don't feel like this typical for their service at Timberyard, but I was pretty disappointed with having to wait 20 minutes for two basic drinks.",3,1,1

While this is one of the best buffets I've been to, that still doesn't mean much. 

I tried to be careful to not have Kogi-syndrome and automatically praise the champagne brunch in an attempt to justify the outrageous wait time (although I recognize some people really do like Kogi on its own merits [Geneva W.!]). I grabbed a plate and started to do a lap around the course before settling on any given item. After walking for about 15 seconds I realized I had already reached the end of the line. I was happy to have been able to add another thing to my list of "ways to break my heart in under 30 seconds."

While the dessert station was good, it in no way made up for the fact that the only item worth my time was the prime rib. As if to mock me, the au jus was placed in an area nowhere near the meat station and was subsequently discovered on my walk out.

For my entree, I had the mushroom papperdelle.  It was really good.  The description is right on except for the lack of mushrooms in the dish.  There were actually very few mushrooms in the dish but it was still good.  Nothing amazing or different but a very good dish.
The drinks were good (strong).  My friends loved their drink called the Slingback--very delicious and sweet.  I had a martini which was good.

Rated at 4* by quite a few ppl gave me high expectations probably. So I had a very different view from the rest of the reviews here. 

We were all quite hungry, 3 of us,  we ordered steam dumplings, bean curd stir fry, fried chicken with spicy salt, fish with green beans, spicy beef noodles..the bill ended up to be $70+tip which is quite a bit considering only 3 of us. 

Our fried chicken came out bloody, they took it back and said will make a new one. Yes I know, it's a Chinese place and 99% of them don't do that. They re-fry the bloody one and send it back out but come on, at least make a quarter of an effort looking like you did. My friend had one bite from a piece and it was on the "new" plate... eww...minus 3 stars please...

- prompt service (not all evening, part of the evening)
- price?

- Food was overly salty 
- not visually appetizing

Last night could not have been a better night. My parents as well as my brother and his girlfriend have never been there before we're with us , along with my fiancée and her parents who have been there before. 

Where to start, the food quality could not have been better. This place always has amazing food and very generous portions. Their regular sized will fill you the factory sized either split it with someone or you will bring some home.

Also the atmosphere in the place is far better than anywhere else. No loud music and tons of things to look at, like the old elevator car converted into a table, or the old carousel with horses that has tables on it, or the old ttc streetcar with dtables inside and all the old stained glass just to name a few.

The service we had was impeccable. Our server Tim made the night more magical than it already was. To start we went there for my fiancée' birthday, well when the meal was done Tim came and did a really amazing card trick for her where he was very accurately able to guess her age using cards the rest of our group drew. He was friendly, kind, caring, and truly loves his job. 

I also proposed to my fiancée  this was last night (Dec 19, 2015) As I asked Tim earlier in the meal to bring champagne before dessert but after the meal. I actually never told him why but he was amazing at remembering every detail that we requested. 

All in all I have to give The Old Spaghetti Factory a 5/5 if I could go 6 out of 5 I would.

We received a courtesy call prior to installers' arrival, and they were prompt, polite, respectful, cheerful, clean & meticulous in their work.

Ok I get that you get me for $123.0 for 3 hrs. At least try and save me a little money.  At least she was kind enough to remove the pre paid gas. Just seemed like a hassle.

I always hit up PH whenever I'm in Vegas - the mall has stores within my price range and a Fat Tuesdays. The casino has a young hip vibe but not douchey, and of course, EARL OF SANDWICH. However, this is my first time staying here.

Upon checking in, I like to do the '20 Dollar Trick' when I check into Vegas hotels. Sandwich a $20 between your ID and credit card and the front desk staff will upgrade you to a better room. Don't do this because it never works contrary to all the success stories I've read online. All you gotta do is ask politely. The lady hooked it up a strip view room since we originally booked a mountain view room. It was a great view of NYNY, City Center, and the Bellagio Fountains.

The room was pretty nice. We got the Dragnet room (movie starring Dan Aykroyd and Tom Hanks) so there was memorabilia everywhere in the room. We had some issues with the plumbing and there were nicks and stretches on the desks and closets, but that's nothing too big to cry about. 

We got the room right off the elevator so you can hear the elevators through the walls, but if you're a deep sleeper it's not a problem. The pool is pretty okay. On weekends, they turn it into a Wet Republic/Rehab place, but on weekdays it's a regular ol pool.

With their location right in the middle of the strip, PH is definitely a place to consider when staying in Vegas.

Sincerely,
The Duke of Planet Hollywood Hotel and Casino",2,1,2

The food here was amazing. I am a Seafood lover so I personally enjoyed the seafood offered here. From smoked salmon, Lobster tail, to Lobster bisque, it was amazing. PRAWNS, not shrimp....actual prawns are offered at this amazing brunch. Other seafood favorites I enjoyed were the oysters and cooked scallops. The caviar though I didn't enjoy all that much. They offered only one variety and it was black caviar and it was SALTY. A tad disappointed as "top of the Mark" sunday brunch in San Francisco offers a few different kinds of Caviar. The cooked food was also good but I can't go too much into detail as I was filled from 2 full plates of seafood. The Filet Mignon and Prime rib were delicious. Desserts were also absolutely phenomenal! 

As for the service, I thought it was alright. My dad noticed that each server took care of 5-6 tables each. The server wasn't THAT attentive in my opinion. Every time I wanted more OJ or champagne, I would have to ask for some more. I also felt like it took a while for the guy to come and clear the table of dirty plates. Very nice guy but could have been more attentive to clearing plates and refilling beverages.

Overall, I give Sterlings Sunday Brunch a 4.5-5 stars. The food quality was excellent and service was just alright.

The place is historically marvelous.  It's like stepping back in time.   You can enjoy classic diner decor.  The portions are generous and the price is reasonable.  It's hard to go wrong with any of the classic breakfast and lunch items on the menu. My recommendation goes out to the SCRAMBLER - a behemoth mountain of fried potato, egg, cheese, meat and veggies smothered in Gravy.  You'll also enjoy their pancake (singular) that overshadows the plate. A single pancake is a meal. Huge portions of coffee cake and cinnamon rolls are also available.

But the food is better than most AYCE out there. The house platter was given to us at the beginning. The scallop sushi on there was definitely good and felt fresh. the house platter sushi was also attractive with garnishes on each piece. The torched sushi was also the best part and adds a good smokiness to the fish. The hot cooked food was mediocre though nothing amazing, felt pre-made.

When My boyfriend called to make the appointment the receptionist did a great job of up selling him to the Bellagio facial. I received an email of my itinerary and what was expected as well as am ementities. I arrived an hour early to take advantage of the sauna and steam room. My boyfriend paid first and I was leaving gratuity in cash. They walked me upstairs to the spa where I had to check into another desk. I walked to another desk where the lady walked me to my locker and showed me where everything was and where to wait 10 minutes before my appointment. When it was time for my appointment the same lady walked walked around with a clipboard checking people in and walking in groups to another waiting area down a long hall. This is where the therapists came to retrieve us for our first appointment. The girl was so sweet and communication was great. She walked me into a clean room and told me where to put jewelry,robe, spa shoes. She asked about previous massages and told me what to expect for this one. She started with a welcoming greeting, which I found nice because it allowed you to stop the chatter and really start to relax! She used pressure with her hands over my body ontop of the blanket. She then put a large hot towel over the blanket which was very comforting and pressed it into me. The massage was vey firm. She put a detoxifying mask on my back and almost laid a paper like substance over it for it to be removed with ease. When I got up, I was amazed for how intensive the massage was, the room was spotless. It was truly amazing. She walked me to another waiting area where I waited for my seaweed wrap. I had never had a wrap before, so I didn't know what to expect. The esthetician greeted me and told me how the service would go. She left to undress and I laid the towel she left on top of me. She also started with the welcome greeting and applied the smelly substance over my body. She explained the benefits of a wrap, which I found very appealing. This part gets a little awkward, thank God the shower was in the room. She didn't attempt to get any of the seaweed off. I was made to stand up drenched in mud etc and walk to the shower to get everything off. I ended up taking a full shower to get the sticky/ smelly stuff off. Next onto the facial, it felt like the massage went on forever. I loved the mask that was used and the esthetician was very knowledgeable about products and skincare. She left a nice little bag with products I might enjoy. I was walked back to the locker room by my esthetician and given instructions to go downstairs to the salon/ nail wing of the Bellagio. It was a little awkward waiting in an open waiting room ( being the only one in a robe) while others waited for hair services. The nail tech was extremely friendly and knowledgeable. A very nice pedicure that came with a peach smoothie. Upon leaving gratuity, was a little awkward. Had My boyfriend not paid in advance, I imagine it would have been easier. I had to leave the spa tips upstairs and the nail tip downstairs which a tiny hole in the front of the desk was for leaving them their tips.

This is one of the first places I drag out-of-towners... usually for brunch. And when I have brunch at Welcome Diner, I usually cannot resist ordering the same thing, the Holy Puerco. Pulled pork, cheesy grit cake, pure heaven.

The best thing about this place, especially if you get one of the rare seats inside the luncheonette, is that it feels like you own the place. The staff cooking and carrying on are an arm's length away. I love the communal "Hurricane!" cheer that resounds whenever somebody orders one of these fresh-squeezed fruit cocktails. Welcome Diner is one of those places that the ambiance overwhelms you so suddenly that you are drawn in to the fun atmosphere... and though you may not be a morning drinker, you can easily be convinced that it's time for a beer or cocktail with breakfast.

I can't say enough about the wonderful poutine here. Other places may just smother their fries in brown gravy, but this place used the white breakfast sausage gravy. Although the cheese curds get a little lost, this is a great way to eat poutine! I also like their choice of either sausage gravy or mushroom gravy if you order the biscuits and gravy (or, do half-and-half, if you must).

The crowd that dines here is cool, the staff is righteous, and the food is spot on. If you want something funky and delicious and scratch-made, you would do well to pound a path to this wiggity-wack little diner in the middle of a dusty old Phoenix neighborhood.

Turned out to be a very expensive oil change as they washed my car (even though I asked them not to and it was on the service order). The car was covered in those little scratches  caused by nylon car washes (My car has never...NEVER been washed with water. I use waterless car wash and detailer. The paint was near perfect). They agreed to buff it out, even though I wanted to take it to my own detailer. When I went to pick up the car, it was parked in a funny location, along a wall so I could not see the passenger side. this struck me as odd. I peaked down the side and sure enough...THEY WRECKED THE FRONT LEFT SIDE OF MY CAR!!! I remained calm, which was not easy. 

At first they tried to deny it. But the white stucco was still stuck in the panel. i walked the service bays and sure enough, thee was Le Mans blue paint on one of the walls. 

Well, they made an attempt to fix the car (which now lost ALOT of value since it was no longer in near perfect condition.)

The repair work was pretty bad. You could see where they tried to "fix" the panel. This is a corvette...Bondo will not due.

Long story short, I wound up taking it to Coachworks to have a professional job done.

What upset me the most is that they tried to hide it and would not fess up to the fact that they crashed it. Sh*t happens and had they been upfront about it, I would not have been so upset.

Needless to say, I have not been back. In fact, I now take my car to California for service since every Chevy dealer here has performed less than acceptable.

1) It takes someone forever (about 3-7 minutes) just to come and take my order at the to-go desk. 

2) 2 girls who work there always ring up my chips & salsa for $5.95. Well tonight I went up there & a different girl was working there and she rang up chips and salsa/queso up for like $11!! I said "Um no, you must have put it in wrong because I always only pay $5.95" and she got her manager and he said the same thing. "No it's 11.97"....wtf? I said "Well can you try to put it in a different way maybe? Because those other two girls do it...maybe try putting it in as like chips and salsa and a SIDE of queso or something???" and he gets an attitude & says no that theres absolutely no way to do that.....wow really? 


3) They finally bring out my chips and salsa and queso (yes I paid the $11) and they bring me a TINY cup of salsa! It was so small...I laughed and said are you serious....normally they give me a NORMAL sized container of salsa...no this microscopic thing, can you bring me a normal sized one considering I just paid ELEVEN dollars for this?" and she brings out a bigger container of salsa and had an attitude and did not say thank you or sorry or one dam thing to me. 

It was some mixed girl (black and white) or something..with a tattoo on her neck.

Because I wanted a yellow gold halo ring most stores didn't have anything in stock that was right, and some places were outright snobby about what I was looking for. Honestly, it was a pretty miserable shopping experience.

We eventually broke down and decided we'd look at getting something custom made, and that's how we found Kimberfire. Thankfully, the entire experience with Jonathan and Kimberfire was the complete opposite of what we had experienced up to that point.

Jonathan gave us lots of information about choosing a diamond up front and made sure we had a good handle on the topic before we even came in. The initial consultation went smoothly and Jonathan did a great job of listening to what we wanted (and what we didn't want) and guiding us through the process. His initial ring design was pretty spot on, but he was also very open to making a few adjustments to it as well.

The ring itself was somehow even more perfect than I could have asked for. I kid you not, it's the prettiest thing I've ever owned and it's exactly what I had wanted.

I'm also still kind of shocked at how reasonable his prices were. My fiancé and I had been worried that getting a custom design would make the ring cost more than we wanted to spend. Thankfully that wasn't the case as the ring's price was pretty much on par with similar non-custom rings that we had seen at mid-range jewellery stores.",0,0,0

We were able to stay in the brand new Paradise Tower over a weekend for $48 per night. A seriously big score! The tower had only been open for a week or so and our room was brand new and beautiful. The decor is kind of goth meets Vegas. The bathroom had double sinks and a huge shower with a rain shower head. Our room had a great view and overlooked the pool. The best part of the room was the bed. It was a big puffy white marshmallow of luscious sleepy dreaminess. I had the best night's sleep I have ever had in a Vegas hotel in that amazing bed.

Checking in was a breeze and the desk clerk was friendly, efficient, and customer focused. The gift shop has a great selection of micro brews for $2.50 a bottle including Dogfish 60 minute IPA and Full Sail IPA...which made me a very happy camper!

They just aren't and that's okay...You go to those types of places for the theme, locale, music, etc.  So during a recent visit to Las Vegas, I was pleasantly surprised to have a tasty meal at the House of Blues.   Here's what we had:
* Voodoo Shrimp - The house favorite, sautéed jumbo shrimp, simmered in an amber beer reduction on top of housemade jalapeño cornbread.  
* Street Tacos - Three street style corn tortillas, green cabbage, fresh pico de gallo, roasted tomatillo salsa, Cotija cheese and avocado lime crème with shrimp; 
* Applewood Bacon Wrapped Meatloaf - A delicious blend of savory flavors wrapped in applewood bacon and topped with our house made wild mushroom sauce, served with fresh vegetables and Red Rose garlic mashed potatoes; 
* Jambalaya - Marinated chicken, white rice, andouille sausage, sweet peppers and roasted green onions in a spicy traditional jambalaya sauce

I don't know who developed the Voodoo Shrimp recipe, but they were working some magic back in that kitchen.  Moist cornbread with expertly cooked shrimp and a killer sauce.  Woo wee!  I think that I'm going start speaking Creole after tasting that dish.  My daughter Muff and one of my nieces asked to have shrimp in their tacos and the kitchen easily obliged.  (That's one advantage of going to a theme restaurant, they aim to please.  No chef driven nonsense where the dish has to remain "exactly" how they envisioned it.)  They were gracious enough to share several bites of their tacos and they were tasty.  I actually ordered the meatloaf and I can tell you that my leftovers were great cold the next day. What does that tell you?  It was great hot or cold and that's hard to beat with that yummy mushroom sauce. (I think that there was some form of sausage mixed into the loaf too that gave it an extra special touch.  Yum!) 


My sister-in-law ordered the Jambalaya and she wasn't really pleased with it. (I try to avoid Jambalaya if it's not in New Orleans or a kitchen that I trust.)  She said that the tomato flavor was too overpowering and sharp.  My cousin thought the same thing on a prior visit.)  Overall, we had a really tasty meal and I was really surprised.

Went with my best friend to finally catch a movie at this new theatre, but a couple things that could have been better though...

First off, the entrance is on the other side of the parking lot, and signage is a bit lacking. Makes it kinda hard to find where to go in when it's your first time (we weren't the only ones confused either!). Upon getting into the building, trying to get the VIP section wasn't any easier. Again, an incredible lack of signage as there was no clear route to the VIP lounge. The staff at the front didn't really explain much either. Would have been nice to have staff directing and at least asking if this was a first time visit to VIP, so that they would get a nice explanation. 

With that being said, after we got in, it was beautiful! Excellent decor, multitude of staff (albeit standing around, but we were quite early), and even a patio, gazing beautifully into to-be condos! Lol. And that was just the lounge area! The theatre itself was spacious with comfortable leather seats! We were the first ones to sit, so we had staff attending to us and explaining everything (finally). They were super nice as well! We ordered some food, which was decent, but probably not worth the price! Just make sure you show your scene card for 10% off. They do have a good system of orders taken on iPads, and sent to the kitchen, which gets brought to you in less than 5 min!

Overall, the seats eventually got rigid (as the backs don't go down very far), the theatre was way too cold, and the whole night would have been a huge dent in my wallet had I not redeemed the actual admission via scene points! Definitely an awesome way to see a movie, but only if you have the scene points saved up. Probably not worth paying $20/admission just to reserve your seat and get served some food. If I do come back, it probably won't be for VIP!",3,0,0

First, the service was horrible. The bussers and other assistants did their job well, but the waiter himself was inattentive. After we placed our order we noticed that we had a choice between fries or vegetable. He just chose french fries.. LAME.. We ordered mixed drinks which were ok, but never asked us for refills. It was almost like going to Denny's to eat, except at Denny's, they ask you what option you would pick for your order!

Now the food. It was blah.. nothing great. Again, i chose the sampler since it went so well at Piamma's... For a salad i had cantaloupe with prosciutto. It was terrible. I love prosciutto and mixed the cantaloupe it was good, but they gave me about 1/2 lb of prosciutto with the pieces of cantaloupe. The plate looked like a bowl of prosciutto and the cantaloupe was buried underneath. Also, i noticed that the "cook" attempted to cut the cantaloupe into pieces but stopped midway.. what the hell was that?

My steak was cooked they way i wanted and it was seasoned ok. However, i noticed that one of my dining partners order her steak medium and she instead got it medium rare.. the same color as mine. Whatever. The creme-brule was forgettable and bite size.

I did my research and was expecting this place to be good. If you're wondering why  I put the quotations marks: that's because the 'spa' is actually just a room in the house where Olga lives. That was the first surprise. 
So i came to do some beauty procedure I've been doing for a few years now. Since I've done that before, I knew exactly what I wanted and explained everything to Olga. 
My second surprise was when she said we need to Skype a doctor first. 'What? you're not a doctor?' I guess I should've left right then. But I was very determined to do that that day so I continued.
After a Skype session with a doctor, she put some anesthetic cream and said we should wait. My face felt really weird, so I had to wash it off 10 minutes later. 
The injections itself were very painful, even though my face was numb and I'm used to pain, and did the procedure without any anesthesia before. That was the third sign.
Unfortunately at that point it was too late. 

Next few weeks very just horrible: I had many complications, went to another doctor who said the injections were done wrong and the product that was used was not a good quality. I called Olga: she denied her mistakes first, but later admitted her fault. I had to take steroids and do some procedures at a different place to eliminate all the bad effects and remove whatever she put in. 

Result: $400 spend on the procedure
2 weeks and $100 spent to reverse it",1,0,0

Service was fast and accurate.

Everyone else had a pasta dish and everybody was very pleased.  Most had "half-orders" which I definitely recommend for females but if you're a man with an appetite you can definitely handle the "whole."

My only real complaint is that the temperature in our area was set to "freeze" which was fine during the salad phase but the entrees didn't stay warm for long once they arrived.

So here I am in the Hot Oven bakery today.  I've noticed that the ingredients used in their traditional winners have made the products taste different.  Somebody tipped me off that they changed ownership a few years ago, which is probably when they changed ingredients...you can tell that the stuff they use now is a lot cheaper. For instance, the meat pies have a darker crust (lard in the crust, perhaps???) and the meat is fattier.  Those meat pies were to-die-for in the olden days.  The classic orange chiffon cake is also darker in colour.  Not sure what they are using, but it has also changed a bit in taste......

No longer do they give out free cookies to the kiddies like I remember.  And, today, they had the nerve to CHARGE ME to write "MELODY" on a cake.  5 cents per letter. WHA???????????????????  I told the lady at the cashier that i have been coming there for 30 years and they have never charged to write birthday messages on the cake.  She told me "it is a labour charge".  WHA????? 30 cents??? Craziness....a great way to tick off your longstanding customers and for what????  A mere few cents? i don't get it.

Oh Old Hot Oven of days past...I miss you!!!!!!",9,2,1

I found the dealer online, they were getting it from, that dealer was located 15 minutes away from Rick Hendrick City Chevrolet.

Location: I guess you can call it Griffintown. It's on St. Jacques in a residential area and unless you know it's there, easy to walk by. Bonus? No problem finding parking. 

Food: Holy Mother of all things delectable and delicious! Loved every single thing that I had. The menu is varied and offers up fresh cuisine using seasonal ingredients. If you go in with a large appetite, you can work your way through their three-course menu. On my end, I had to skip the Primi to leave room for dessert! We had:

Antipasti:
Mozzarella w/fried eggplant - I generally don't like eggplant but really enjoyed this. It was almost like eating thickly cut chips. These weren't greasy or oily at all, and the mozzarella was amazingly fresh and soft.

Prosciutto w/fresh basil and peaches: Again, something I don't usually eat, but I did Not regret my choice. The prosciutto was melt-in-my-mouth delicious and the melange of peach and basil was absolutely perfect. This dish isn't on their regular menu.

Primi: We skipped this course but they had some delectable options that included spaghetti w/shrip, orange and pistachio,  and Busiate w/tuna, peas and mint. You can order half or full-sized portions. I think the idea here, is to order the half and treat it as a second appetizer. 

Secondi:
Halibut w/fresh corn polenta, green onion and bacon. My date ordered this and loved it. The halibut was fresh and perfectly cooked, and the portion was pretty generous. 

Lemon sausage w/crushed potatoes  and zucchini chips. Again, something I don't normally eat (sausage) but I was so intrigued by the idea of a lemon sausage that I went ahead and ordered this dish. The sausage is homemade with pork, rabbit and zest of lemon. I was worried it might be a little dry but this wasn't the case at all. The sausage was served in a tightly wound spiral and was moist and so damn good. The crushed potatoes had a lovely flavor and the chips were perfectly cooked. The remaining sausage juice (that sounds bad, right?) was served over the dish, making the overall experience flavorful and awesome. 

Dessert: 

We tried the homemade doughnut with peach marmalade and either marscarpone or fresh meringue. I really don't remember which of the two it was but I'll go with the marscarpone as it wasn't sweet. I'm generally not a doughnut person but this was SO good! The doughnut was topped with cinnamon brown sugar (I think). It was just so damn good. 

We also tried something-chocolate ganache that was served with berries and coulis (and ice cream). There were three chocolate thing in total, and flavor-wise, this dessert is perfect for chocolate lovers. The only thing that I found annoying was that they were bloody hard to cut. I had to use two spoons - one to hold down my chocolate and the other to try and cut the pieces off. This is not to say that this dessert wasn't fresh - it was. The texture was just very, very firm :)

Price: It's not cheap - for two people, the total was $166, however bear in mind that we had three glasses of wine and two lattes. I will definitely return, but probably for special occasions or you know, if I win the lotto - then I'll go every week. A definite must if you love great food and a great ambiance. The staff were super friendly and attentive. 

The restaurant is very small - I think it fits about 30 people. It's also a hot spot so call ahead to make a reservation before you go.",7,0,0

Decided to try this place based upon other reviews and the portion sizes are indeed big, however the quality of the food is sadly lacking.  I got the hash with roasted rosemary chicken.  I asked the waitress what type of chicken it came with since I only eat breast meat and she said it was all breast.  Well I got the food and it was mostly breast but there were quite a few pieces of thigh in there.  Not a huge deal as it is too much food anyway but the chicken was so dry that I needed a drink of water after each bite.

You know, that list you keep of places you plan on coming back to, again and again? It might be purely mental or physical, but when someone within earshot says "i'm in the mood for a Reuben" that list springs into action.

Scott's Generations is at the top of that list, for sure.

I've never ever had sandwiches, nay sammiches, quite like this. But, being from California I've never had the pleasure of an authentic Jewish Delicatessen either. Our table ordered a half-and-half Reuben, a jumbo philly cheese steak, and my order, the James Cagney: a beef brisket sammich on an onion roll with coleslaw and some amazing chunky fries on the side.

My mouth is watering purely from the memory... My friends and I each kept half of our respective orders, but cut the other halves in two so that everyone could get a taste of everything. The cheese steak wasn't bad, but I've had better. My brisket was GLORIOUS, and I savored every bite. I even got up to grab some mustard for accompaniment but it went unused since it was so perfect and juicy. I have to say though, that the quarter piece of the Reuben I tried was definitely my favorite thing on the table. AH! IT WAS SO GOOD!

Not only can Scott's build a perfect sammich, they back it up with stellar service and great attitudes. It was a little pricey, but I also felt that for the price you got a TON of food! I'll be back soon. and again. and again and again, with friends.",3,1,3

The ham was so moist and tender, and the bacon was crisp. I loved the smoked fish section...three different kinds in addition to anchovies. Delicious! 

There were about 5 different flavors of cream cheese. Many buffets just serve those little prepackaged Philly cream cheese containers. I had the cream cheese with chives on my bagel with smoked salmon and capers. Wonderful. 

They had a section of pizza...even a breakfast pizza with breakfast sausage and egg. I didn't eat the pizza, but it looked like it was a popular option with many guests. 

There was an omelet station and a good selection of fruit. The orange juice did not taste fresh-squeezed, but the coffee was tasty.

We came on a Friday night, hoping to get a quick meal in before my boyfriend's basketball game. He had the spinach/cheese stuffed ravioli and I had an alfredo dish. The pasta was cooked very poorly and was very clumpy, it seemed like we could have made better at home. The alfredo seemed very oily, the bacon I had added to it was sparse and lacked flavor, and the ravioli was unappetizing. We also had an order of garlic knots that they forgot about, but once we did get them, they were underwhelming and both the sauce and the bread lacked a lot of flavor. My fiance is normally a garbage disposal when it comes to leftovers, but after packing up most of our food and taking it to-go, we ended up throwing it away the next day. I think this place is still working out some kinks (i.e. the cashier seemed to forget to give a lot of tables their utensils, which the runner had to end up doing). I do appreciate that they make their pasta fresh and they have fresh herbs growing in-house, but nothing about our experience made us want to go back. It looks like the place has a lot of fans though and I'm sure will continue to thrive and improve.

We were out of the room until approx. 5:00pm. During that time my jewelry box was stolen.

He did explain that Loss Prevention would be in contact with us in 5-7 days. When we contacted the Loss Prevention Dept. later the following week he informed us that according to their records there had been some activity in our room while we were away.

The gentleman I spoke with told me that someone could have removed the sign while passing by and we had no proof that the sign was there. I explained that when my husband and I returned to the room that evening the sign was still on the door. He told me that the person who entered the room had a "stellar" reputation and was a long time employee with no complaints. I guess the question is why did they steal my jewelry regardless of weather the sign was on the door or not, which it definitely was. Why would someone enter my room without cleaning it, changing the towels etc. There was no signs that anyone had entered the room other than to take the jewelry box.

I wanted to write this review to share my  Biaggio's experience.  My wife and I live in Henderson and we were going to a church meeting in Summerlin. Instead of picking up the pizza's at our typical Henderson pizzerias, we decided to try a place closer to where the meeting was. I got on yelp and found Biaggio's. My wife placed the order online. Our meeting was at 6:30 and we got to Biaggio's at about 6:15.  It turns out they had the order wrong. They only made one pizza and it was the wrong pizza.  We ordered two.  We decided to wait for them to make the two we ordered. We sat down and Biaggio came to the table and immediately offered us drinks on the house. I said no thanks, we are in a hurry.  He then brought out an envelope with a $30 gift card.  We were shocked, this went above and beyond in customer service. A few minutes later, the pizzas we ordered were ready. We went to pay, and he wouldn't let us.  Everything was on the house. Not only did he give us the two pizzas we ordered for free, but also the pizza they mistakingly made, with wings and garlic knots. We couldn't believe it. we have never had better customer service. When we got there we were really annoyed, when we left, it was one of the best restaurant experiences we ever had.  By the way, the food was outstanding. Pizza was great and the garlic knots are out of this world.  Biaggio's is what all restaurants should be - great food and great customer service. We will be back.",0,0,0

The food itself is average for the most part but you won't leave disappointed nor still hungry.  You just won't be overwhelmed in my opinion. They also have a larger selection of Thai food items to choose from so you may want to go a few times to figure out what you like best.

When we first got there, we were intrigued by the decor and atmosphere and didn't mind the wait (initially told it was going to be up to 1.5 hours, but that it could be much shorter). We left our phone number with the host and went to the bar next door for a drink. 45 minutes later, we called to check on our reservation and were told that they supposedly texted us 10 minutes prior as our table was ready (we did not get any texts). Either way, we came back and were promptly seated...albeit with only one menu for the four of us (I had to grab one myself from another table). This is when things really started going downhill, which is a shame because most of the food was pretty good.

We all ordered drinks, but only two eventually arrived. We had to remind about the other two 20 minutes later when we realized nothing else was on its way. Then they continued to randomly bring out our tapas dishes without any thought to the order and with very long breaks in between. One of us didn't get any of her four orders for over 30 mins and had to watch others eat. There were two orders of grilled cheese and they came out 45 minutes apart after we inquired about the second one. They completely forgot a dish until we inquired about it at the end of our meal. Bone marrow was undercooked (they comped it on the bill without us saying anything about it, so we assume they knew). Our main waiter didn't remember anything any of us ordered and some orders were getting brought over by different people. Worst of all, we didn't receive much of an apology throughout the ordeal. All we got was a  dismissive "it's that kind of night."

This is a real shame because this is a unique restaurant and lamb lollipops, sashimi, and tuna tacos were great. I recommend the bone marrow or the grilled cheese.

So as a preemptive measure I put in a premium unit for the upstairs last fall before I moved in and crossed my fingers on the other unit in hopes that I could get it thru another season, So the weather was almost 100 and my downstairs area was not getting cooler. The condenser was not turning on so I did what any recent new home purchaser would do, I called the Home Warranty company.

The technician figured out the problem right away and resealed the leaking SVC value and pumped in a couple of pounds of freon. It's been a few weeks and everything is working perfectly. That's some of the best $75 dollars that I have spent. It's nice to come across professionals in the HVAC world that are servicing their customers properly.",7,6,5

My suggestion get it hot, with cheddar cheese instead of swiss and forget the ham and ask them to serve it up with some onion rings instead.

Our server was good and kind.

The food was a huge let down in terms of flavour and being Italian.
2 of the popular options (osso-bucco and the mushroom "ravioli") were not available.

The Gorgonzola Fig was a huge let down, gave the impression it would be a bunch of small figs stuffed with gorgonzola and wrapped in prosciutto. Basically it was 1 piece of a small fig with a quarter oz of cheese and like 5 pieces of prosciutto around it.

Carbonara was so bland, undercooked onions, pancetta wasn't nice and crispy, no flavour. On top of that, clearly it was boxed pasta (not fresh),
Should have figured from the hundreds of boxed pasta around the kitchen.

If I was to eat at a chain on this evening (and I do so often and somewhat willingly), it was going to be a place that offers the kind of food we don't get much of in Western PA. 

The decor is as kitschy as a B-52's gig. Giant straw canopies hang from the ceiling. The pillars appear to be made from trees. None of the help looks or sounds as if they hail from the Carribean, but it is likely that some of them spent or will spend a Spring Break there. Billy Ocean didn't drop in. Ben Zephaniah probably wouldn't like the place. Jimmy Buffet might own stock in the franchise.

Authentic or not though (and I certainly have my doubts), Bahama Breeze lived up to its namesake in that the food was just easy to like.

Our opener was a serving of the Crab Claws St. Thomas.  Blue crab is used, the generous amount of tiny claws swimming in a snappy "Island Citrus Butter". A loaf of pillowy "Cuban Bread" comes to the table in a bag (to keep it fresh) for the purposes of soaking up that wonderful butter. The crab claws were fun to eat and required no hardware or labor. You just put them in your mouth and pull that dainty meat off with your teeth. If there were 100 of them, we would have finished them all with extreme prejudice. 

I so wanted to try Jerk Chicken, but at Bahama Breeze it's served with pasta, which seems so...touristy? Is that the right word?

Note #1-One really cool thing Bahama Breeze does is offer a "lighter portion" of many of their dishes, a godsend for those on a diet or on a budget as you get less food and pay a little less. That little perk almost made me order the Jerk Chicken Pasta as well as a few of their other entrees.

Being true to my blue-collar, sandwich-loving, Friday-state-of-mind self, I instead ordered a Cuban since I really wanted to try a good one, not a Panera-grade one (see my reviews archive). 

Lo and behold, it's a dandy and flattened oven-baked Italian hoagie with Swiss cheese in lieu of Provolone, "Cuban" bread in lieu of Italian, pork, and more familiar components in tomato, lettuce, and mayonnaise. No pickle or mustard was to be found, however. Not that I minded as this was one hearty yet tidy and planar hero, artfully sliced in half on a bias. 

Note #2-Another cool thing about Bahama Breeze is their choice of sides. In the case of sandwiches, the choices include mere french fries, a tomato salad, yellow rice with black beans, and my pick; the brisk, fresh, palate-restoring fruit salad. Grapes danced with pineapple chunks in a ramekin as a small scoop of orange sherbet oversaw the affair. 

Kay's Chicken with Cilantro Crema was good enough, but the mashed potatoes that accompanied it were a symphony of spud, roasted corn, and a trio of cheeses. 

For dessert, we traded off on the Chocolate Island and the Bananas Supreme. Once again, cultural cred is in question, but the flavors were undeniable. I preferred the mousse/brownie silo that is the Island and the sea of chocolate sauce and vanilla bean anglaise that surrounded it. The Bananas Supreme is Bananas Foster collaborating with that school fundraiser classic, Banana Nutbread. It's warm, there's butterscoth, brandy, and vanilla ice cream involved; it's an effortless winner. 

Being that this Bahama Breeze is the only one of its kind in this side of the state, it's easy to forget that you're dealing with a chain here. The quality food only helps to further that end. 

And now...Bad Brains...

One day I had my headphones on and was in my zone (probably Britney Spears The Zone) and some guy taped me on the shoulder. He asked me how much fare was. I asked him if he needed one way or a transfer back down. He seriously looked at me and said, "Why would you need a one way ticket?" I was dumbfounded by this question. I said, with a pause "...because people live up here..." I don't know if he thought maybe the houses were fake and just for fun or what. 

Moving on. The Mon Incline is probably the busiest of the two inclines in Mt. Washington. It's because it's right by the main part of Station Square, another very touristy destination. There's pro's and con's to taking this incline. I would definitely say more pro's because again, it's right next to Station Square, it's lets you off right by the main street, Shiloh Ave., in Mt. W. and of course has the fantastic views at the top! the con's are that it can get VERY busy and backed up during the summer nights or if there's a major event going on in the city (Fourth of July, Steelers Games, New Years Eve, etc.). 

As I've stated before, it's also part of Pittsburgh's public transit system so if you're visiting from out of town, you may see some grumpy people heading home from work. I also had to point out to a confused tourist that a radio tower she had pointed out to her family was in fact NOT the Cathedral of Learning at the University of Pittsburgh.

 "Larry, do you see what happens when you **** a stranger in the ***?"  

Well, I am that stranger....lets see what happens:

~The Good~
In a clean, convenient location, this place offers a great one-stop option for all medical imaging needs. The staff were attentive and immediately helped me when I came in for a general check on my side. Once again, good service all around, no issues wit that.

~The Bad~
SO... I am at work yesterday and my fiance calls me. Bill in mail. Its not from SMI. It's from a collector. They are "demanding payment" of $48.79. Thats right....SMI sent me to collections for not even $50 bucks, and to top it off, I was never made aware of the balance. It's been over 3 months since the procedure was done. At the time, I provided my address, phone number and insurance carrier on that not-so little patient card they had me fill out for 30 minutes. 

WHY...WHY would you collect my phone number and contact info if you are not going to call me to alert me to a billing issue? Even more of concern is why you wouldn't mail or contact me before SENDING ME TO COLLECTIONS!? I pay my bills...and now I get a collections in the mail for less than a carton of smokes? 

~The Downlow~

Customer Service...This boils down to having good customer service. As a customer service rep myself, I know personally that if I had a client whose account went not only delinquent, but into collections, and I never bothered to advise them....I'd be in line at a local job bank. The ridiculous notion that this is the case...is just unfathomable to me.

I am not sure what the original balance was, or how it even occured. Aetna never advised me an amount was over-due...and certainly I wasn't sent anything either. Obviously this will baloon if not paid. I will pay it, but not before reaming the office manager when I get the chance to. It is this office's fault on not advising me of the balance due...and if they say "oh XYZ in accounting should have followed up with you....blah blah blah", I will probably lose all my hair as I keep myself from blowing up like Pompei.

They get 2 stars for their nice office and relatively good reps working with patients....but thats me being nice.. Adios SMI, see if I use you again. All for a measily $48.79 that you could have advised me on...But nope... Not going back, and I suggest you do not either.",4,0,1

One disappointment was finding this place. It's literally in the corner of the two buildings in the lot. There's a sign on a wall (that needs a little more to make it stand out) We obviously missed it and ended up driving into the next lot. We then saw the main sign when we were on the street. Sooo for future reference: it's between a Shabu-Shabu restaurant and Brighton Family Medicine. 

We walked in and it was surprisingly small and packed in there. We came at 9am, thinking it was going to be a bit more empty... Nope! People like eating early lol. Despite how busy it was, we were seated immediately. I wasn't too thrilled with our server, I don't even think he introduced himself. But he did check on us a couple times and made sure we had what we needed before disappearing.

It was packed in there and just as loud. I could barely hear myself or my sister talk. That's where the fifth star went -- disappeared with my unheard words. 

The food is where the four stars came from, though! There was a lot to choose from, everything sounded delicious! I ended up with the country Benedict. Pretty much country friend steak just on a biscuit with a side of house potatoes. The house potatoes reminded me of Thanksgiving stuffing because of how it looks but it tastes better lol. 

I'm coming back to try other things (monkey bread!!!) and maybe sit outside to be one with nature -- sucks it was super windy today and I would've died from allergies.

It is obvious to anyone that can see him that walking is almost impossible for him as his left leg is number and his back pain extremes yet no one offered a wheelchair to help him to his room (which was the last down the hall). We make it there and I help him sit...not the nurse...on to a chair/bed that DOES NOT EVEN WORK, and did I mention the nurse failed to offer or give instructions on the call button (I understand I was in the room with him but what was to happen if I was away and he needed help?!) After my husband sat it agony in the only position available I could not watch him in pain anymore and requested, politely, we be moved to another room with a working bed. Again, no wheelchair offered...and again, the furthest room. The nurse pointed towards the room and that.was.that. We were never (in any of the rooms offered pillows or blankets, and again...no call light) So I took it upon myself to the job that should have been given..the genuine care & concern for someone's comfortability...especially in a placed dedicated to patient care. I was able  to locate the pillows, locate & places cases on them and make the patient comfortable. I am, in no way complaining as I will always take care of him...but when the nurses don't show compassion, that's alarming...and I should able to focus being by his side. 
My husband was given medicine to help with pain and....30 minutes later, no one has checked on him. 45 minutes later, I went to ask what was happening (I.e will there be imagine or other tests that we are waiting in) Dr. Larson decided it was an unnecessary risk with exposure. He explained his reasoning in a kind and gently manner that put my mind at east. He asked how his pain was and explained that mild or no relief. As Dr. Larson began explaining the process a rude nurse replied with a comment in a tone that certainly did not represent a field of compassion "oral medications take an hour to take affect". The explanation  could have reflected more care.  
I have been to this facility myself and was treated with the upmost concern and genuine care, seeing my husband treated so poorly is upsetting. Patients come for care, not to have their genuine concerns brushed off with rude bedside manner.

I took the PT course, to figure out whether or not coding was really something I could do and to get a more serious taste of what I would be doing if I pursued this as a career. 

To put things in perspective, my background was in Tech sales, with no other prior coding/programming knowledge or experience. I started considered Web Dev as a career change because it was a way to become my own boss and escape the 9-5 rat race. Skills wise, I knew that I had a strong interest in technology and I wanted to work with something that would allow me to flex my brain muscles, problem solve and create something. 

The part-time course is intense, if you're not truly interested or committed it will be easy to fall behind. The first few weeks were the most challenging as I struggled to make all the pieces fit together in a way that I could comprehend. It is not unlike learning a new language, at first it's really difficult and overwhelming and then one day, poof! It starts to make sense and you're like, hooray! I'm a developer!! Until you realize you're SO NOT a developer yet, 5 minutes later.

That said, I found the instructors and mentors to be knowledgable, approachable and really invested in helping you learn. I found that coding really requires you to have a tenacious sense of problem-solving, you're going to spend a LOT of time staring at your screen, hands up in the air, screaming 'WHY?! WHY YOU NO WORK?!" (I did this. a LOT.) This is important because while the mentors and instructors are there as resources, they are not (and should not) be spoon-feeding you the material. If you're not willing to really dig in and do the work, this is not for you. 

Personally, I feel that I am prepared for the Full-Time course but will definitely be putting in extra work to get more familiar with some concepts and details that I missed when I was away. The PT is great at giving you basic and broad knowledge of key concepts but is by no means a comprehensive course that will spit you out as a hire-ready developer-- that's what the FT is for!

If you're considering it, take the plunge and go for it! This course is quality quality quality, and worth every penny.",0,0,0

According to 1 salesperson, they basically carry the same brands, yet, the stores themselves feel worlds apart.

Firstly, the Saks & HR (West-end) are completely DEAD.  Ghost town.  Background music barely audible.  Sales staff shootin' the shit 'cause there's no clients to approach.  When you do need help, staff are few and far between, maybe 2-3 for the entire beauty department, as opposed to a person for each different beauty counter at Nordstrom.

Aside from the International Students from China, the clientele at Saks/HR also seems older.  Atmosphere is also a bit snooty.  Nordstrom?  Hired DJ, paying a mix of tunes with Holiday tracks subtly sprinkled in between, a mix of clientele, bustling.  The merchandising at Nordstrom is also better, makes merchandise appear fresher and newer.  At HR (Square One), merchandise seems outdated.  I'm sick of seeing rows and rows of Ray Ban mirrored aviators...so yesterday, plus they look shit on me!

There was also a helpful salesperson (Jordan) at the Le Labo counter.  Jordan took his time to share his expertise and personal recommendations from the line.  When I visit the Saks counterpart, there is NO ONE there.  Great for spritzing myself with expensive perfume, terrible when I actually want to buy a bottle of that perfume or need feedback of other scents from that line.

I loved all of the appetizers and the mains, but the eggplant appetizer and the greens in the main were especially amazing. The injera was fluffy and sour, the way it should be. I also tried one of the micro-brewed beers on the menu and it was great. The only reason this is a 4 instead of a 5 star review is that, given the ingredients used (lentils, split peas, veggies), it is quite pricey. $30 per person before tax/tip/drinks is a lot when every other Ethiopian restaurant I've been to (and I've tried many!) has charged around $10-$15 while serving a similar amount of food. It's true that the quality at Nil Bleu is top notch, as was the service and ambiance, but it's hard to want to pay double what you would elsewhere for very similar food.

Edit: Forgot to mention that none of the dishes were spicy, which for some people might be important for Ethiopian food. I still thought they were all delicious, but the person I was with was disappointed.",1,0,1

I believe our server required additional training as she made the entire family feel as if she did not want to be at work on this Saturday evening. Perhaps something was troubling her and for that I feel terrible. Unfortunately, it spoiled our experience forcing us to leave only a 7% gratuity where normally Flemings staff deservingly earns over 20% from us. There were several mistakes made throughout the evening and rather than sitting and enjoying a second bottle of wine and more drinks, we chose to go elsewhere. Carl, the manager on duty politely came by to check on our experience, however we felt mentioning our disappointment at that time would have only further soured the evening.

Since that time, we've visited a handful of other local haunts to compare it against, so I've developed a fairly good idea of how well this place compares. 

Given the business 13th Floor does, combined with its heavy promotion, it definitely offers a pretty good production value. Sets and actors are both very well done. I really like the cool additions, such as the tilted room, spinning room, and swamp area. Like most haunted houses, being in the front of a group is where you end up having the most fun due to that unsettling feeling of impending doom you feel going around every corner. When you're in the back, you're simply just watching the people in front of you jump and scream.

I guess that I imagined that during the off-season, the owners would spend time completely reworking the entire building to give everyone a new experience the following year. After returning both in 2015 and 2016, it seems that they do make some changes to keep things fresh, but the general formula pretty much stays the same.

I like that they have a food stand, which offers some good old-fashioned carnival junk food (funnel cakes and curly fries), but this is only available if it's closer to Halloween.

Overall, I do feel that it's worth checking out. But it seems like if you've been once, there's no need to revisit. With the space these people have, as well as the business they rake in, I feel they have the potential to create something much, much more exciting than what they're currently doing.

The fountain Pepsi products were the only beverages.  The spoonful of "wasabi" coleslaw came in a plastic condiment cup and I could scarcely detect the hint of wasabi.  The fries were pretty bland and barely seasoned.  I'm not sure why the only cheese that they serve is mozzarella.  I also didn't care for the sauces everyone else is raving about.  They were disappointingly mediocre.  I like spicy stuff, but the only spicy sauce was also peanut and the spicy clearly came from Frank's Red Hot (which, at full strength, isn't all that spicy).

In fact, when I stay at local hotels in Scottsdale, I ALWAYS Hotwire it and end up spending about $50/Night on average. Because of this, my reviews tend to lean towards a more generous star rating than they may actually deserve if we were paying full price.

That being said, I think Mondrian gets a bad rap because it's easy to hate on. Yeah, the butt lamps are tacky, the rooms are small and have what look like boobie tassels hanging from the counter, and wtf is with the sheep thing?  But honestly, the service was great from start to finish (with the exception of a slightly bitchy pool bartender), the drinks were strong, and I really didn't get a pretentious Scottsdale vibe from any of the other guests. The pool had enough plastic around it to float a small village but really who doesn't like a good pair of fake boobies for your Saturday afternoon enjoyment? I know I do.

We checked in early (around noon, when our room wasn't guaranteed until 4) and it was kind of a late birthday party for me so since I knew their pool was opened to the public I invited some friends to visit. They met me in the lobby and I asked the front desk person about the pool policy. He said there is a cover if you're not a room guest but slipped me 3 extra "guest passes" so my friends wouldn't have to pay! To top it off, our room was ready immediately! AKA they didn't look at the rate I paid before deciding to make me wait until the very last possible second before letting me into my hotel room (a la Valley Ho).

The valet guys didn't turn up their noses when we said we'd rather self park, they just gave us directions as to how to park the closest to our room. When we checked out, everyone asked how our stay was and the same front guest guy invited me back to pool for round two.

For the pho- the broth was flavorful. Meats were tender. Noodles cooked well, but was not as abundant as pho from other establishments. Basil, sprouts, and jalapenos provided were fresh and colorful. Siracha, oyster sauce, and a house chili sauce were available. The chili sauce is recommended. 

Spring rolls are well sized and came with good consistency peanut sauce. 

Atmosphere was more hip than other Vietnamese restaurants I have been too. Seemed like a solid place to take a date.

Primary objective entering restaurant was to enjoy a bowl of pho with all the meat variations, peppered with basil, bean sprouts, and chili sauce. Objective was achieved, meeting expectations.

Wow were we wrong, the portion sizes are WAY off for the price. 

The El "Big Easy" Fajitas for Two - price will set you back 24 dollars, keep in mind the average single entree will run 9 - 12 .

Decided to try something new at the apache taco show and am so glad I did. Got the fish taco and no joke it's the BEST fish taco I've ever had. Before my favorite was wahoos but the flavor, and size of apaches fish taco blew wahoos away. It's tender, not fishy, fried outside that crunchy, not soggy. For 2.99 it was huge and I wish I would have gotten a second. The chipotle sauce they put on it gives it a kick that really brings out the flavor. They don't skimp on the cabbage and put it on two corn tortillas that don't break. 

The second taco I got was still good, marinated chicken. I found out you can get it on a flour tortilla too but I stuck with corn. So much meat that you could almost order another corn tortilla ad stuff another. Great prices for portions, and I find myself having more food than I can eat. 

Rice and beans taste super fresh, and again I love I watch them make everything and grill it. 

What's new as well is that they changed their salsa bar and now I can't stop raving. They added a new chunky green mild one that packs a punch after you start chewing. And they spiced up their salsa, the brown chunky one. Now I have no complaints! This is the perfect taco place for me. (sorry tacos la Mexicana!)",17,9,13

The sauce the wings are tossed in use an enchilada sauce with some taco seasoning. Then they throw it in the oven to melt a Mexican blend of seasonings. It wasn't spicy at all if you're worried. My favorite is still the Louis N Anna though. 
My son had the chicken fingers (plain) and the Mac n cheese. Wow! Those may have been the best fingers I've had! The GM (I assume?) said there are ruffles potato chips in the breading as well as some secrets that he didn't divulge. Very good! Chicken was very tender. Annnnd the Mac n Cheese. It was incredible! I don't know where but there is definitely bacon involved in it somewhere. Has a subtle smoky bacon flavor that goes great with the Mac n cheese. 
The Ranch and the blue cheese were both very good. Pretty certain that they are made in house. They have other renditions that I'll try next time (siracha honey and hickory ranch look tempting).

I was very anxious because I'm 42 years old and my regular Doctor has not been too encouraging about having a baby at my age (eventhough I'm in better shape than most 30 year olds).  So, I was very curious to say the least. We talked to the genetic councelor first and she asked about our family history...we pretty much decided at that point that we would not have any invasive procedures but just a blood test.  Then on to the ultra sound...I cannot express enough what a totally remarkable experience this was! Dianna (the sonographer) was an angel sent from heaven! She spent at least an hour with us showing us every part of our little GIRL (yes, we found out the sex...and I cried tears of joy because it just made it more real). Dianna was extremely positive and excited during the entire procedure...she truly brought my pregnancy out of negativity to absolute joy and excitement. 
Afterwards, Dr. Wold came in and introduced himself.  He took a look at the sonogram while we all watch. He said he was very pleased with what he saw and let me know that I'm super healthy for my age and he said "...you are very blessed."  Those words have changed my world.  I highly recommend this place.  It was so nice to have encouraging words instead of someone just spitting out statistics.

Vegas is considered a foodie destination city but according to foodie sites like Vegas Eater a lot of the gems aren't on the Strip. No1DP obliged, knowing that there was going to be a cab ride to and from the hotel.

CONCEPT: The restaurant of chef/sommelier Bank Atcharawan "the Riesling dude" (formerly of Lotus of Siam - helped develop the wine list there with focus on Rieslings), who won one of the "Sommeliers of the Year 2013" from Food and Wine. While Lotus of Siam's focus is on northern Thai cuisine, Chada Thai is focused on southern Thai cuisine, a region unexplored by many Thai restaurants. Bon Appetit also listed this under its top 50 new restaurants. 

CAB FARE: ~$13 from the Palazzo. 

VENUE: Like most Vegas off-strip restaurants, especially in Chinatown, it's located in a nondescript strip mall. The cab almost missed the restaurant as we approached the area where we thought the restaurant was and I had to look through the door to confirm that this was the restaurant. 

The inside has a minimalist look. Picture frames were along the wall where I sat. The main focus was on the large wine racks in the wall closest to the entrance to the kitchen. No1DP notes that the main focus would be more on the wine list and food. For a Friday night at 9:30 there were only several groups dining in. 

SERVICE: Good service, considering they only came by when they thought they were needed and left us alone most of the night. They also made good menu recommendations. While we were eating they also told us that 15 minutes prior to leaving they can call and arrange a cab to pick us up as they noticed that we arrived here via cab. 

WINES
No1DP: Reuscher-Haart Piesporter Riesling, Mosel, Germany (Riesling, $8). A crisp and slightly sweet Riesling. I normally don't like whites but his wine was better than mine and I seriously considered sharing another glass with him. 
Me: Bouchard Pere & Fils Bourgogne Pinot Noir, Burgundy, France (Pinot Noir, $8) Light and earthy and made a good sipping red. 

FOOD: No1DP and I decided to go a la carte.
Som Thum Goong Pao ($11) - Green papaya salad topped with grilled prawn. Papayas were crunchy, sweet yet slightly tart. Shrimps were grilled just right and had a slight crunch. 
Yum Kai Nok Kata ($6) - Fried Quail eggs, topped with dry shrimp, cilantro, onion. Spicy lime dressing. Egg was a mixture between poached and over easy. Yolk melted in mouth yet did not leave a mess on the plate. Dried shrimps definitely added a sweet and spicy kick. 
Pad Kee Mao (Drunken Noodle) with Lobster Tail ($21) - Flat rice noodles, hot chili, garlic and basil. Lobster was separated so that the dish can easily be shared. Lobster texture suggests it was cooked just right. More notably the noodles did not have a heavy taste, which meant that it wasn't cooked with TOO much oil. 
Seabass Tod Krueng ($19) - Pan fried Chilean seabass glazed with chili paste. Fish texture was SOFT and could be separated with a fork. The chili paste gave the fish a kick. No1DP notes that unlike cheap spices, where the spice is sharp and dissipates quickly the spice kick just lingers in your mouth a minute. Right amount of ginger.   

Most notably about these particular dishes was that sub-par Thai dishes have a very heavy feeling after you eat them. That was not the case with this restaurant and every dish we had was still quite light. This was a pleasant surprise as we wanted to have room for 3-course dessert afterwards.

Definitely will be back to try out more dishes and to have a crack at Bank's Riesling collection.",2,0,2

I ended up ordering their prime rib sliders and everyone else ordered sandwiches, wraps, and burgers.  The food arrived and my disappointment continued. 

The sliders looked as if someone angry in the kitchen was handling these smashed up buns. These were not by far a prime rib sliders but more like thinly sliced roast beef things.

As a disclaimer, I have been fortunate enough to visit the Cheba Hut on The Hill in Boulder, and I am astonished at how starkly contrast my experiences have been between the two locations.

At its core, Cheba Hut offers unique and quite tasty sandwiches at an appropriate price. The Magic Mushroom sandwich with the works is probably the best vegetarian sandwich available via delivery in Madison, and I've heard The Kind is also super solid.

That being said, it is so disappointing to have a would've-been-amazing meal ruined by the worst customer service the fast food industry has to offer. My in-store experience was mediocre at best, my food having taken fifteen minutes in a line of two sandwiches. Employees aren't helpful, and don't seem to know what they're responsible for. It generally seems disorganized.

When you order for delivery, your sandwich might arrive in an hour fifteen (if it arrives at all, because this store doesn't seem to honor every order, based on whether or not they feel like making and delivering it -- seriously) wrapped in aluminum foil, soggy because of poor packaging and cold because it sat around fully dressed before someone felt like delivering it.

Beautiful outdoor pools, packed dance floor, several bars to choose from and even some gaming tables by the big bar across the pool from the dance floor.

Although we didn't know it at first step inside but Diplo was the DJ for the night. That explains the big crowd and why the dance floor was so packed. He played good music.

When you settle on your order, the server will first layer a bed of rice and then top with a variety of items including tuna / salmon as your protein and then continue with veggies, edamame, seaweed salad, crab meat salad and corn plus other items of your choice.

Despite a 10 min walk from the office, I would go back and try to the other bowls.  The regular size is good enough for me but if I'm starving, I may upgrade to the large size.  The place has a few tables but I usually order take out.",0,0,0

I emailed this company since I have just recently moved to Arizona and needed a fill for my lap band.  I was told that I would have to "join the club" for $500 to even get a fill.  They sounded like a coupon company saying that the first "fill" was included.  They also insisted that I needed to give them my insurance info.  I let them know that I would be paying cash and my insurance would not pay for any of this.  I asked if this was a problem.  They said it was fine and I set up the apt.  I went in today and was 15 minutes early for my apt since I knew that I would have to fill out paperwork.  I had an attendant take me back and weigh me and asked me to wait in one of the rooms.  Another attendant came along and told me that they were checking out my insurance to make sure that I had coverage.  She then closed the door and left.  I was so surprised by her statement since I was going to be paying cash that I waited for her to come back.  I had not been at that office close to an hour and still nothing was happening.  I kept on getting the feeling that they were trying to find out exactly how much they could charge my insurance company even though I had told them that I was paying cash.

I finally went to the receptionist and told her I was leaving since I had to get back to work and I also could not understand how they made me wait for my insurance company when I would be paying cash.  

They explained again that even though I was paying cash, since they were "responsible" for me, they would have to get approval from my insurance company.

I really got upset and asked them if they did not take cash customers, why did they set up my appointment.,  the girl finally got embarrassed and became quiet.  I told her that I did not mind that they needed to make money but trying to fleece my insurance company did not induce any confidence in me that they actually cared about their patient.

I have been very fortunate in the past with my previous surgeon and his office and I am really sad to see that this company is only about making money.  Please seek help elsewhere.",7,1,1

I was with my friends and my boyfriend just last sunday to eat dinner and we were assigned to this server named Jessica. At first, she was still okay getting our orders until the time that she asked me what i want. Now since my boyfriend and i will be sharing a big streak, i ordered a calamari and she asked me, "is this your meal?". WHAT THE HECK! Why would she ask me if that was my meal? That isnt right. Who cares what i wanna order! So i just let it go. My friend ordered a three course meal. The soup came and then the steak. And then she stopped serving us. The mashed potato which should be with the steak never came until we got the attention of another server and this other server got it for us. Jessica never even bothered to check on us if we are ok. As far as i can remember, if you are a server, you need to ask if everything is okay. Now come on! This is an expensive place! We have to pay our money's worth by having a nice meal with a good service. And still, we kept our cool. We looked around for Jessica and she was only serving like 2 tables and it wasnt even a busy night. I called her to ask for another bread. Guess what? It never came. And then the dessert which should be included with the three course meal? NEVER CAME. So we decided to just pay and ask her for our bill. We called her for it and waited and waited... NEVER CAME. This is really a bad service among all the restaurants that i have dined. And this server is not really happy with her job. We have no choice but to talk to the manager. My friend talked to the manager...(too bad, i forgot his name) but he was really nice to us. He kept on apologizing and even gave us a discount and had our dessert as "to go". 

The food was not something to really rave about. But the mashed potatoes were really good. The steak was tender and good as well. The only complaint i had was the bad server named Jessica so if any of you want to eat at this place in Vegas, please ask for another server if they will give you Jessica.

Good...
I booked a reservation for Sunday brunch because I really hate waiting around for a table and when we arrived at 300 East, even though we were early, the hostess brought us right to a table despite others who had arrived ahead of us without a reservation.
The food was excellent. I really enjoyed my crabcake benedict. Lots of crabmeat! The cheese grits were excellent. The coffee was good. My wife really enjoyed her meal as well. and especially her peach fizz.

Bad...
Service was slow. The food took a long while to appear and when it did, it was not very hot. Barely warm. But we *hate* sending food back and so we both dug in rather than complain.
The wait for our check was a long one..
There was a big chip in my water glass on the lip.
$2.75 for a refillable cup of coffee. Really.

They are infested with roaches and the apartments in the back have rats. I have been here for 2 years and I have had it. There has been a change in ownership 3 times and each time it gets worse. They come in , they paint it and in a few months they are gone. THE NEWEST MEMBERS OF MANAGMENT ARE DISCRIMINATORY AND HAVE BAD BUISNESS ETHICS! There is a 5 day Grace period for paying rent. On the 5th day I paid my rent and they tried to tell me I was late and had to pay a 90$ late fee. I DID NOT ! No where in my lease does it say I would have to pay a late fee on the last day of the Grace period. When we checked online there was no sign of an increase of our balance. It was shady because she (the skinny Hispanic woman in the office ) wanted us to give it to her in a separate check or in cash directly to her. I DID NOT! This past month when I went to pay I called in at 5 :15pm on asking them to wait 1 minute exactly after 5:30 pm(ACCORDING TO GPS) and I would be there. The woman (Large Hispanic woman) in the office said to just come tomorrow morning because they close exactly at 5:30 and they are locking at exactly that time. I asked if they could please spare one minute and she said "no, to bad , I should have been there earlier ". Keep in mind I get off at 5 , drove to get a money order 10 minutes from my apartment and had to wait in line and traffic both ways. I also got paid that day. And had yet had a chance to go. So I rushed through traffic to get there and when I did it was 5:27pm. I had 3 minutes before they closed.  We walked to the door and she was standing there with the door locked and her purse in her hand. She looked at me with a smirk and shrugged her shoulders. I showed her my phone and said "it's only 5:27pm , I have 3 minutes " she rolled her eyes and reluctantly opened the door. SHE TOLD MY HUSBAND "WE ARE LUCKY WE PAID BECAUSE SHE WOULD HAVE SENT US TO COURT FOR AN EVICTION". I WAS ON THE 5TH DAY OF THE GRACE PERIOD.  If we would have not paid that day, they would have stuck us with the 90$ late fee. Needless to say the newest owners suck! RUDE AND DISRESPECTFUL! COMPLETE CHIMPS THAT HAVE NO COMPETANCE. If you live here , RUN ! If you don't,  consider your self LUCKY. They kicked everyone who had section 8 out and are very rude to people of color.

This stay started out great, but lost some steam each day, and ultimately failed.
Good check-in, great clerk. Nice room on the 25th floor. Arrived for First Friday, caught the shuttle to the Arts District for the fest.  All good; a bunch o' fun.
THE BAD: Either one or two of the 4 elevators were down the entire stay.  Very long waits to and from the room.  Took the stairs down once but the stairwell dumps you out into the hotel's back alley which is probably not where you want to hang...
THE UGLY: On Sunday night about 1:00am, construction began on the room renovation directly above our room (this would not have been a problem on Friday or Saturday, but Monday morning?, yeah, thats gonna be a problem...)  Could NOT sleep through it.  Called front desk, they said we had to move rooms, so at 1:30am, we shlepped our bags down to the 17th floor to escape the cacophony.  The hotel apologized and comp'd us $50 food/beverage credit for the inconvenience.  Later that morning, we got up, not well rested--oh well, its vegas after all--and ate breakfast at the D Grill (you may want to read the separate review for this place before going), and charged it to the room against the comped credit.  Found out later they never comped the $50 to the room and I got charged for everything.  In the process of discovering this, I found out: The D and Golden Gate will implement a $20/night resort fee as of August 19, 2013, so thats really a nail in the ol' coffin -- er, the ol' Fitzgeralds, er, The D Hotel.

I ponied up and paid the premium to enjoy a little luxury for a weekend at Bellagio, but unfortunately was a bit disappointed in the room and don't feel that I got what I paid for.

ROOMS :
The "renovated/remodeled" rooms have been redecorated with walls horridly painted with tacky 70's retro lime-green and bright purple swirls/flowers (?), definitely taking the anticipated luxurious feel down a few notches.  Everything was in decent shape and functioned properly, but the only thing that impressed me about the room was the push-button shades/sheers (wall mounted, not remote).

LOCATION:
Bellagio's location on the strip is pretty good, but then again, so is Imperial Palace's.  That being said, I didn't leave the property for the extent of my stay; so I guess there's something to be said for the casino.

POOL:
The pool(s) area is pretty large, but nothing exceptional beyond that.  A few of the smaller pools have fountains (these are not heated), but most are just standard, rectangular, 3 or 4 foot deep areas to wade around in.

THE BANK:
The Bank (the nightclub at Bellagio) is nice, a decent size, and has tons of tables if you'd like to purchase bottle service.  As a hotel guest, you can get free entry before around 11:30pm.

BUFFET:

I was immediately surprised by the decor of the restaurant, tastefully rustic and inviting.  Our waitress greeted us in a timely manner, we ordered our drinks and entree and we received our sodas immediately. Unfortunately, this is where the enjoyment of the evening ended. Our entrees arrived and low and behold my wife's burger was not at all what she ordered and her smashed potato was loaded with sour cream, not as ordered. I don't know if this was the kitchen, the server or what, but it was returned. In the meantime I dined on my corn shell beef tacos and non vegetarian Spanish rice alone. I don't quite get the difference between the rice I had and the vegetarian as there was no hint of any meat in my rice, if there was supposed to be. The corn kernels in the rice were overcooked and chewey, the rice was dry and the dish overall lacked any distinctive favors, bland and disappointing. As I picked up my first taco, red grease dripped from it onto the stainless steel taco holder accompanying the small pool of red grease that had already solidified on my serving platter.  My corn taco shell was obviously a standard food service shell and not homemade. Not only was the beef saturated with grease, it was also bland and flavorless. Good ratio of lettuce but lacking in cheese. In the meantime the manager stopped by and refilled our sodas. After waiting over 10 minutes my wife's replacement burger arrived, not as ordered with tomatoes on it. The manager again passed our table, this time noticing my wife had an entree in front of her and inquired how our meal was, which our waitress failed to ask. We calmly explained our experience thus far and he did the right thing by offering to replace the entree and then comping her meal. In the meantime I'm done with my meal, my wife is just starting hers and our waitress is AWOL other than delivering the check. Overall our waitresses service and attentiveness lacked and in my opinion, she was not at all deserving of the $2.70 tip that my wife so generously provided.

This place is going to be a solid four star in the future.  I have been here twice now in the past week and I really like the food.  To have a tapas, asian fusion place in Henderson is pretty cool and with all the cool cats hanging out at the LVAC, I am sure this place will be a "go-to" restaurant in the future!

1.  Location - 3 star - This is at the 215 and Eastern on the NorthWest corner.  Near the LVAC and in the place that was formerly Xtreme Sushi and Steak.  Very similar upscale and funky interior with a great exterior patio seating.  It was almost warm enough to attempt to sit outside, however we were ill prepared.  There are a variety of tables, booths and plenty of sizing for large or small groups. Love the location, but it is difficult to get to at times due to all the traffic and all.  However, if you can navigate here, you will do well.

2  Ambiance - 4 star - As mentioned, plenty of tables and booths.  A small cool bar in the middle as well as a small sushi bar off to the side.  In my two times here, I did not see people really hanging out at either bar, yet when this place get's busier and it will, I am sure it will be hopping. 

3.  Food - 5 star - The food here is definitely very good, and we have tried so far many of the dishes. 

Lucky Rice - Some concoction of sticky rice perfectly flavored with kim chee, fried egg and bacon.  We added the pork belly option and this is a dish that you will keep on eating and eating.  Tasty and addicting.  The only problem with this dish is slowing down a bit to taste it.  The texture, flavor and taste is just about perfect.  This is something we will eat every time.  We had both the regular Lucky Rice with all the meat and one vegetarian one without meat as it is Lent....

Lettuce Wraps - They have both the vegetarian and one with chicken.  We ordered the vegetarian and it was great, when we did get it.  It had Mushroom, Daikon, Eggplant and Carrots.  Great flavor and of course fun to eat in the little lettuce wraps that they give to you.

Shishito Peppers - These were cooked to perfection.  Nice taste, not spicy, just a hint of pepper.  More vegetable but cooked to a nice crispy and charred texture.  Made this so flavorful and mouth watering. Yes, you have to enjoy veggies to like this, and I have had Shishito Peppers at many places and enjoyed it here so much!

For the RobataYaki, we had Chicken and Scallion,  Kabocha Squash, and Maitake Mushrooms  These were all very good, tasty, and served on little platters with the skewered delicacies!

Fries - Yes, we ordered something as dopey as fries.  It was a Friday, most of us were on "Lent" so no meat. We were hungry, and heck the fries looked good.  You know what, as odd as it seems, and I am an Asian Foodie, I really enjoyed the fries and I normally never order fries or eat them!

The Dessert - The Funkler and the SnowBall - Wow, we were about to leave and I was actually yelping for a good dessert place and was about to go to Snowball Shavery all the way in C-Town.  I had a guest here from New York, so we were on an excursion of food before her flight back to the Big Apple that night.  We were about to pay and then one of the other waiters asked us about dessert and we said....What the Heck!

The Funkler - A Chocolate chip Blondie with ice cream and chocolate sauce. The size of a huge slice of pie, we devoured it. The blondie was really great tasting and the ice cream and sauce made this a la mode hunk of chocolate chip was definitely plate licking worthy.

The SnowBall - Yep, those good ole Hostess SnowBalls that I had growing up.  Chocolate cake wrapped in a fluffy marshmallow  and coconut and pink!  So much better tasting than the Hostess one. This has a more dense texture and heavier cake.  Made for an awesome tasting dessert  Came with some kind of ice cream.  I was not sure what it was exactly.

4.  Service - 3 star at best - In my two times here, I would say that they service was okay.  First time was lunch they kept servicing us from the far side of our table, over all the condiments and so far away from us.  Very odd.  Second time, we had dinner and it took about 10 minutes for the waiter to come take our drink orders, it took about twenty minutes and two reminders to get our drinks, then when we ordered, he left out two orders and got one of the vegetarian ones, entirely wrong and brought it with meat.  We never got the two other orders, but since I checked the bill and they did not charge me, we didn't ask for them. It was too late and we had a plane to catch.  A good point is that another waiter came out and corrected the vegetarian order and gave us a take home box for the meat order and did not charge us. That was cool.

You are only as strong as your weakest link so I feel that once they get their wait staff fully up to speed, this place will be a solid 4 or 5. On a good note, we had one main server, and three others helping him so I love teamwork!",9,3,7

The selection for lunch wasn't that great and quite a few of the items look like they had been sitting out for quite a while.  They didn't seem to be too worried about keeping the items full.   The quality of the food was not terrible.  The fried chicken was pretty good.  The roast beef was too bloody rare.  The sushi and pizza were not edible.  Dry and not fresh at all.  The asian dishes were ok.  I think the only real stand out items were the smoked salmon and fried chicken.  The rest of it was on par with a lesser buffet off the strip.  

They have brunch and lunch together, so they had some breakfast items that weren't bad.  The dessert station was severely lacking.  The highlight was the gelato bar which had about 10 different flavors.  The rest of it was mostly those little cake squares you've seen a million times at every other buffet in the world.  No bread pudding, no pie, no chocolates.  Very surprised at how limited their selection was.",1,0,0

At the end of May of 2017, a new doctor examined him and found a lump in his belly.  She took xrays and found a mass on his left kidney.  I was originally bringing him in because his upper respiratory side effects were getting worse. This new doctor showed me his xrays, and told me he had days if not weeks to live, and sent me home with pain medicine for him as she thought he was terminal.

After a few weeks, I decided to get a second opinion from another Vet (The Big Easy, in Lawrenceville).  I brought my cat's records and xrays with me from North Boros.  The new doctor told me my cat's left kidney was enlarged, and that it could be a tumor or just an enlarged kidney.  She threw the pain medicine vial away, told me to stop giving it, and prescribed antibiotics and prednisone to try and relieve his respiratory symptoms.  She told me he was losing weight because the only way cats can smell or taste food is through their noses; and if his was stuffed up, this could be the reason why he was not eating normally.  She also suspected he might have lymphoma and the prednisone would be a medicine of choice.  She saw him being interactive with her and me, told me he could live for quite a while with just one working kidney, although his bloodwork was fine and perhaps the enlarged kidney was still functioning, and told me he was far away from being euthanized.

It is now September 4, 2017, and my cat is eating, interacting with me by cuddliing, purring and wanting to be next to me.  He does not seem to be in pain at all.  I am giving him the prednisone every other day, and lysine powder for his nasal symptoms.

Lesson here:  ALWAYS GET A SECOND OPINION!!!   I was in tears in May, but not now.  I  know my cat won't have a lot of years left, but he will be comfortable and as happy as I can make him with the help of THE BIG EASY ANIMAL HOSPITAL!

I spent well over $700.00 at the first vet, and have spent only $150.00 for the CORRECT Vet!

I will never, ever use North Boros as my Vet. for any animal I may have.  In fact I believe that they owe me some money for the very bad advice and doctoring I received from them.  BEWARE OF WHO YOU TRUST FOR YOUR PETS' CARE!",1,0,0

The ATVs were fabulous on their own (I had never been on one), but zooming through the desert, nearly no one else around, with jaw-dropping scenery at every turn... can't beat that! The Subway lunch at the top of an antique barn, overlooking the canyon, was also amazing. Everything about this experience exceeded my expectations, even after reading glowing reviews beforehand. My two tips for the ATVs that I wish I had known: 
(1) Bring gloves. I got blisters. Still worth it though.
(2) Bring a water bottle with a built-in straw. They did provide commercial bottled waters, but you can't drink from them (other than super-awkwardly) through your helmet. It would have been easy if I'd had a straw. You can always refill your bottle from the ones they provide.

Since  I was having my car serviced out in Henderson on Saturday, I decided to give this place a try. We arrived at about 9:30am and we had a five minute wait from the time we walked in to sitting down. The hostess that greeted us was really friendly and made us feel welcome. I noticed there was outdoor seating but it was not offered. I suppose I should have asked..... Anyway we sat inside towards the back of the restaurant and it was a good location to watch the action and quiet enough to have conversation. They play some good music but at just the right volume. 

The menu is full of some fun and different meals. It was a hard choice to pick just one but I ended up ordering Tacos Huevos and Mom had the Eggs in the Basket. She is not too adventurous when it comes to breakfast but her meal was still a good choice. She ordered coffee with her meal and the coffee cups are huge. For those coffee drinkers out there, you won't be disappointed as you can get your caffeine on with these cups! They also offer all kinds of flavored mimosas from your basic orange to guava. I enjoyed the peach which was more like a Bellini but great way to start the morning. 

The food arrived and the presentation was nice. There were three tacos with potatoes, eggs, chili's, avocados and crema on top. The salsa on the side had a nice kick and complimented the mini tacos. Three tacos was the right amount to serve as one more would have been too much. The Eggs in the Basket came with wheat toast and the egg was right in the middle of the toast with two strips of bacon on top and a little slaw. 

Our service was very good and the decor is a touch of modern and homey. When you first walk in there is a mini bakery with fresh muffins, monkey bread, and other assorted breads for sale. Everyone that works there seems to be very friendly and cool. I accidentally spilled my Moms coffee and it was cleaned up very quickly. Only one draw back, there is only one bathroom which when the place gets busy means you gotta wait so watch how many of those mimosas you drink (Ha! Ha!). 

We left about 11:00, and there was a wait at this time with lots of people sitting outside enjoying the beautiful morning. This place is pretty easy to find, you just have to be careful not to pass it when you reach the light at Horizon Ridge Parkway. It is in a strip mall and on the corner.

I definitely plan to return again so I can have the chilaquiles next time!",4,1,5

First and foremost, the service was friendly and the staff did a great job. Secondly, the food was well worth it. 

To start, they bring out seasoned popcorn that was quickly devoured by us.

Ceasar's Palace...you were a great trip...but you did send me mixed messages at times.

What you need to keep in mind:
-ROOM TYPE, ROOM TYPE, ROOM TYPE.  Research what you are booking, go to YouTube and look at video reviews...this will greatly impact your stay experience.
-Agustus Tower: Big room, not a great bed, sunken tub with jets is amazing.  Double sinks are luxurious...but overall appointments are average considering you have to pay more.
-Casino is oddly shaped...I have never liked playing in Ceasar's because it's dark and super smokey (not near the outside doors - no air circulation)

He stated that I was responsible for it not the owner, I explained to Joe that the owner had hand written a letter that I still have in my possession that states ( I apologize that you have not been receiving any notification for changes in your condo you will now begin to receive them) which at this point was to late. Joe states that he would get in contact with owner and have a resolution for me a week went by nothing I then called multiple times and left voicemails and nothing.

Points to ponder:
-Parking sucks. When you self-park, good luck finding your car. Its a trek!!!
-Steps to Cosmo casino. We found ourselves gambling next door!
-Steps from the strip. Easy access.
-Elevators take forever!
-Hallways are quiet. I didn't hear people walking the halls or thru the walls, etc.
-Bathroom fan was really loud?
-Bad view from our room but we were barely in the room.
-Free movie rental and popcorn in the lobby.
-There's a small convenience store in the lobby. (Items are more $$$).
-You get a packet upon check-in. Read the materials because there's freebies!!!

The advantage of such a monopoly is you pay for it. A recent trip with a 15yr old to watch a film cost me £23 for two tickets, a hot dog, small juice and a handful of sweets. Staff can be pretty indifferent, but that's no particular criticism of Vue.


 The usual plague of loud-mouthed teens who love phoning each other and generally prefer the sound of their own voice to that on screen is prevalent here, and the management aren't inclined to do anything about it. You might get lucky if you can pick and choose with your viewing times however.


 If you can wait, chances are the film will turn up at Eden Court instead and you'll have a far more enjoyable, comfortable experience there, but sadly EC doesn't get all the blockbusters so for the avid filmgoer Vue can sometimes be your only choice.

Facility and equipment - 4 stars
Class itself - 2 stars
Overall - 2 stars

Quick background: I recently moved to LA, however my parents have a 2nd home in Scottsdale and I visit them on a frequent basis.  My dad loves road biking and I love spin, so I wanted to introduce him to it.  

Customer Service - I am a member of Classpass flex allowing me to take classes from fitness studios on class pass in any city where it is available.  I attempted to sign up for a class at RPM Spin as they are listed on Classpass, but was unable to as the class was listed as full.  I went to the RPM Spin website, saw on the home page that your first class is FREE so I created an account, registered for the class, and was put on a waitlist as it was full via the website.  I did the same for my dad.  The following morning, I received an email we had been added to the class and I called to confirm.  We were greeted by the owner upon arrival and asked for our AZ ids.  Neither of us have AZ ids as I now live in California and my dad's permanent residence is not AZ.  I understand the studio does not want non-residents taking advantage of their one free class, but I feel this should have been noted on the website stating "Free class. MUST BE a full time AZ resident and AZ ID required."  *Probably not the stipulation to strictly enforce due to the fact that 30-40% of Scottsdale's population is seasonal. 

I, on the other hand, let the owner know I attempted to sign up through Classpass the prior evening, but the class was blocked.  She had me try registering for it again via my Classpass app, but I still wasn't allowed.  I felt at this point a customer service-oriented business owner would have made the exception for all the trouble I went through.  Instead, as I watched the room and bikes fill up during this back and forth, she had my Dad and myself pay the $18 drop in fee.  Side note: I am not one to expect a free lunch and I probably wouldn't even be leaving this review if the website noted that the free class was only for Scottsdale/Phoenix residents - no exceptions ... but I probably also wouldn't have gone to check out the studio.

Facility - The space was clean and all the equipment was new, modern, and in great condition.  Once class began, a curtain was pulled making the studio dark which I personally prefer when spinning.  There was minimal black lighting and colored light panels that alternated along with the music that I appreciated and felt it brought a cool element to the class.  The instructor was elevated, although inline with the front row and facing the same way as the rest of the class, so it was hard to see her and follow her cues.

Class - Definitely an intense workout for your intermediate to advanced spin class goer.  I would like to note here that I chose to attend the hybrid class based on the description listed on the Classpass and the website - a mix of both standing and seated riding.  The class was 98% standing.  Again, if an out of the saddle spin class is your preference, this is definitely just right.  I was expecting something different and felt mislead.  The instructor did say you could sit at any time, but never gave cues as to when a sitting option could be interchanged with standing.  No warm up just jumped straight in.  Every song included choreorography.  As I said, just relaying my experience and not stating whether good or bad.  If you love bouncing to the beat from start to finish this is a great class, but if you are looking for intervals, a combination of seated and standing rides and a mixture of some choreographed songs and some rides focused on sprinting, running and jumping with no choreography, I wouldn't recommend.  I did enjoy the music throughout the class.  The playlist was current and included a motivating mash up rap, edm, and hip hop.  It was really, really loud though making it difficult to hear the instructor's cues and I began to get a bit frustrated.  And I promise I am not being grumpy and crotchety as I do enjoy jamming out in my home and car and I attend concerts and music festivals on the reg.  

Disclaimer: I am not a huge fan of leaving less than positive feedback on yelp without expressing my thoughts in person as I think its a copout.  However, as I walked out the door, I was awkwardly asked if I wanted to purchase a package and I felt it was more of a sales driven question and I was not genuinely being asked for my feedback.  So I am turning to Yelp.  My intention of writing this review is to provide Yelp users with feedback and a general synopsis of what to expect from this spin studio - not necessarily good or bad depending on what you are looking for in a spin studio.",8,1,1

so the beef wellington, after watching and hearing it over and over on his shows, i was imagining someting that will blow me off the chair, but after the first bite, i thought "oh so this is what is like", and... that's it. well, the fillet migon was very nice, melts in my mouth, can you imagine a chunk of beef that melts? but the crust becomes soggy so fast so i didn't really enjoy the combination of some wet soft pastry and a piece of perfect steak.. 

we also ordered two appertizers, fried pork belly (1 piece) and yellowfin sashimi (2 pieces) and two drinks. bill came to $230 overall.

would i go again? maybe when they bring scallop risotto to the main menu.

My husband got the Char Broiled Filet Mignon, which was the best cut of meat we've ever eaten.  I got the Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras.  I've never had duck before, but it was a nice meat. It was a bit chewy, but it had good flavor.

Get one of their soufflés!  It takes 30 minutes to cook, but it's well worth the wait.  I also recommend the Non-Traditional Caesar Salad as a salad option.

They gave a complementary birthday dessert, as well as little petit fours to close the meal (such a lovely touch).

I also ordered a Pineapple Rum drink that was tasty but not worth $20, in my opinion.

Greeted and seated very quickly as I was eating alone. (I think they may prefer reservations because they do seem to have a lot of clientele). Obviously I chose this restaurant due to a yelp search, yet it was the garlic bread pictures that won me over was looking for something traditional versus garlic knots. Only ordered a glass of malbec wine $10 and a house salad $8 and Arancini $8. Food came out quickly, literally 5 minutes. Yet I didn't receive my complimentary garlic bread for a bit, asked a waiter about it and then got it. Salad was very good and fresh tasting, not even a huge fan of tomatoes yet they were very ripe. The House Italian dressing was very tasty. The garlic bread was definitely just what I wanted, very buttery and tons of garlic on it. Can never have too much garlic in my opinion. The Arancini was flavorful but I do think maybe it could have  been a little warmer/hotter, and possibly deep fried just a touch more so that when they are laid over the tomato sauce they wont get soggy as quickly. They were slightly breaking open due to them absorbing the tomato sauce liquid. The server suggested a Malbec wine, it was indeed a very good choice.

Yeah, I know, it's just interior scratches to the X3, but we've worked hard to have a luxury vehicle and take pride in owning it and I strongly feel they should have owned up to their responsibility and have taken care of this mishap with their insurance.

The trip was paid for with their hard earned money, they even splurged for good seats on Spirit Airlines for their trip.  They arrived at Las Vegas McCarran International Airport with all of their necessary documentation and even printed their boarding passes at home to avoid unnecessary charges at the airport.  They even made sure their luggage was not over the required forty (40) pounds per bag as required by Spirit Airlines.  All went well.  The flight departed as scheduled, and they were off to a glorious vacation!
When they arrived at Detroit Airport, they only had forty (40) minutes until their connecting flight to Cancun, Mexico.  That was no problem, because the flight even landed a little bit early, and the gate they were departing from was very close.  When they deplaned, it was discovered that the flight to Cancun had been delayed for three hours.  Not a problem, it would give them time to eat a bite before their flight.  After about an hour, they checked the departing flight board and to their surprise, the Cancun flight had been CANCELLED!  When they asked a Spirit Airlines employee what the issue was, the employee rudely responded with, "Go downstairs to baggage claim and they will re-book you."
They went downstairs to baggage claim and were greeted by an exceptionally long line of one hundred and fifty (150) people, waiting to be re-booked.  During their wait, they were never told what exactly happened to our flight except that there were "mechanical problems."  They assumed the plane was broken, so they continued to wait in line for FOUR HOURS, while TWO people were handling the re-booking of the one hundred and fifty (150) passengers.  They were offered no water, no snacks, and no explanation regarding anything.  After the long wait, they were put on another airline to complete their trip, but not until the NEXT DAY.  
Even though Spirit Airlines paid for their hotel and gave them meal vouchers, they still lost a night in fabulous Cancun, Mexico which cost approximately $450.00 and plenty of happiness.  They later found out that the flight was cancelled due to a "crew issue."  Lie #1 from Spirit Airlines.The next day, the couple continued their trip to Cancun, Mexico on American Airlines (which they also had to pay $50.00 for their luggage) and arrived without issue.  Their vacation was fabulous, but like all good things, it came to an end.  The couple arrived at Cancun Airport and boarded Spirit Airlines flight number NK-240 to Ft. Lauderdale to catch flight NK-777 back to Las Vegas, Nevada.  The flight went well, and they even landed a bit early in Ft. Lauderdale.  Suddenly, a flight attendant came on the loud speaker to tell them that they had to hold the passengers on the plane for twenty (20) minutes because customs was backed up.  This wasn't a huge deal at first, as the connecting flight to Las Vegas wasn't for an hour and forty minutes.  Little did they know, Spirit Airlines had a glitch in their computers and reported that there were ten (10) American citizens on that flight instead of the one hundred and ninety (190) that were actually on the aircraft.  The couple ended up missing the connecting flight to Las Vegas.  Distraught, they went to the Spirit Airlines desk and were told they could only book them on a flight the NEXT DAY, which wouldn't get them home until 5:00 p.m.  This particular couple has to work for a living (hence the mention of hard earned money in the first paragraph) and they needed some time to get their life back in order to return to work Monday morning.  This option was not acceptable and they asked for a refund.  The customer service agent stated she would refund this leg of the trip and it would take seven (7) to ten (10) business days to receive.  They called a family member in Las Vegas and found an American Airlines flight leaving early the next morning and would get them to Las Vegas at noon on June 18, a day later than anticipated.The couple was then burdened with finding a hotel room in Ft. Lauderdale, which Spirit stated they would not help with because the delay was, "Not their fault."  Lie #2 from Spirit.  I know this because a recently received email from their customer service department stated they missed their flight due to "inclement weather."  We all know this is another LIE.  Lie #3 from Spirit. The couple found a hotel that had a shuttle and were able to get a few hours of sleep before flying to Las Vegas the next day.  This concludes my story about the vacation the couple experienced.",4,3,0

We purchased two doors. Then it came to the installation....our installer, Clay was on time and did a nice job, however he noticed that the "sweep" or whatever they call the piece of metal on the bottom of the door that holds the rubber was several inches too narrow for the front door, he told me he did the paperwork and someone would be calling me either later that day or the following Monday - no one ever called me. I gave them about a week to call me then I started making phone calls, it took many calls to finally get someone to at least tell me they "were the correct person to fix my issue." She failed also. All I kept hearing was "I'm sorry that happened" and "I'll have to ask a (different) manager about what's going on a how to fix it." 
When they finally said they'd be out I asked if the person would be coming with the correct materials to fix the issue, I was told that, yes, he would be. Well, when he showed up around 8:30 AM he did NOT have any materials with him. "He was just there to look at it." Really, are you kidding me?? I was assured that he would be back before 5:00 because he just lives a couple of blocks from me, he would take care of it, it would be repaired before my guests arrived at 5:00. 5:00 came and went, when someone finally showed up after 6:00 (and it wasn't the guy that promised me he would be there) it took him about 45 minutes to fix it -- that was 45 minutes aways from my guests. I asked where the other guy was, he said, "he couldn't come." 
This was a horrible customer service experience! I get so tired of hearing "I'm sorry", if more effort was made to actually help the customer everyone wouldn't have to keep apologizing. I finally had to keep telling them to stop apologizing, "I'm sorry" wasn't going to fix my door!! This company has "too many chiefs and not enough indians" - so to speak.

I went a couple of months ago for a work trip with 4 other people from my company, 3 of which were of the same opinion as myself about the food.  

We started with the salad with Gibby's signature dressing.  I will pat Gibby's on the back for their AMAZING homemade salad dressing... I tried to buy a bottle or two, but they were repackaging it and didn't have any on hand at the time.  I'm sorry to say the salad dressing was the highlight of the evening and things went south from there.

My coworker and I ordered the beef wellington next.  I have never tasted a more bland and utterly inedible piece of meat in my life... my coworker felt the same.  I wouldn't have taken a second bite if my boss wasn't paying $50 for the thing.  It tasted like it was barely sprinkled with salt - no other marination whatsoever.  The accompanying mushroom gravy, A1, and Worcestershire didn't help either.  I couldn't imagine how much worse it could taste reheated, so I most certainly did not take the rest to go.

Another coworker who ordered the rib eye steak was also not impressed, even after dousing it in the sauces mentioned above.  Another coworker order the fish course, which she was not fond of either.  Our team is from Texas and we've had some truly great steaks there for half the cost of Gibby's.  

The service, however, was excellent.  I couldn't bring myself to mention to our kind and attentive waiter how disappointed I was about my main course.

The Smokehouse Turkey had turkey, Bacon and Gouda cheese on grilled Texas toast with sun dried tomato hummus, lettuce and tomato. A terrific combination. A bowl of the chili on a cold day would hit the spot.",0,0,0

Because it's not bad enough that we found a bed bug, we had to deal with shitty ass employees that hate their jobs (with the exception of a few). Seriously though, by far the worst customer service I have ever received in my life, mostly dealing with the Hotel manager, and a few of the bellman. First off, they managed to mess up our reservation, thank goodness we had printed everything out because their computers said we were leaving a day earlier than what we had paid for. After waiting a lengthy time at the registration counter, we finally got settled into our room. Less than an hour later, we find a bed bug!!!!!!!!! We bagged it up & took it to the front desk....a security supervisor went in to let the hotel manager know what we had found and sent him back with new keys to completely different rooms. I was absolutely shocked that an industry based on customer service would be such cowards to not address the issue nor apologize to us for our inconvenience, the least the manager could've done was walked out & apologized, clearly he was too busy. So they give us new rooms & we get there & housekeeping has just arrived to get them ready.....seriously???!! I was pissed, I wasn't in the mood to wait another hour until our rooms were ready so I called the front desk & asked to speak to the manager which in turn gives us two of the shittiest rooms I have ever stayed in & called them "suites". From ripped up curtains to cabinets missing drawers & broken lamp shades, I was speechless. I will NEVER stay here again & I will make sure no one I know ever does!",4,0,0

So it's a good place to go grab a pre dinner drink at the bar but don't bother going there to eat dinner.",0,0,0

Kanoa provides individualized attention throughout the class to ensure that 1) you are doing the exercise correctly so you don't get injured and 2) you are challenging yourself. Kanoa also offers numerous classes throughout the day from 6am-7pm to accommodate different schedules. The people who attend are like a family-very friendly and encouraging.

They are students so the service is a little slow but once your food arrives it is fabulous.  My husband and I ate there for less than $15.00.  We had lunch and an ice tea.  I had the Cobb salad which was delicious and my husband had a caprese sandwich with a salad.  I had to ask for a togo box because it was so big.  It is in a deserted part of Mesa.

This is some of the best Indian food we've had. The vegetarian dishes are outstanding, especially all of the Okra dishes. The meat dishes, both with sauce as well as the Tandoori dishes, are also great. When they ask if you want it mild, medium, or hot, mild is plenty hot for me. Seriously, if you ask for a "hot" level of spice, it's no joke.The buffet is really good too. The people that work here are so nice. Jaipur is the best.",0,0,0
